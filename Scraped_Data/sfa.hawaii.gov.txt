•	Educational	Specifications,	or	“Ed	Specs,”	are	programming	standards	and	planning	concepts	used	to	guide	new	school	
construction	and	major	space	renovations	to	create	engaging	and	effective	learning	environments.	Ed	Specs	will	serve	as	the	
SFA’s	guide	to	the	architect	and	engineering	community,	providing	a	path	for	designers	to	work	with	SFA	staff	and	school	
communities	to	define	elements	of	the	built	environment	that	will	best	serve	students.	They	will	ensure	the	development	of	
equitable	facilities	across	the	capital	program.
•	The	Educational	Specifications	provide	a	framework	for	how	new	schools	should	be 	constructed	and	existing	facilities	
modernized.	While	these	Educational	Specifications	are	intended	to	serve	as	a	long-term	guide	for	decision-making,	they	should	
be	regarded	as	a	living	document	requiring	ongoing	review	and	update	to	respond	 to	constant	changes	to	educational	delivery,	
practices,	strategies,	and	models.
•	The	Educational	Specifications	are	a	guide,	and	as	such,	should	be	applied	to	each	 school	project	in	the	context	of	site-specific	
circumstances	and	nuances.	
Please	note	that	some	existing	school	facilities	in	their	entirety	and	components	thereof	may	be	unable	to	undergo	modifications	to	meet	the	standards	
outlined	 in	these	Educational	 Specifications.	 In	these	circumstances,	 deviations	 should	be	explicitly	 reviewed	 by	SFA	project	staff.	In	some	cases,	decisions	
will	need	to	be	made	on	whether	a	new	facility	should	be	constructed.
The	Design	Guidelines	are	a	companion	volume,	developed	simultaneously	with	
the	Educational	Specifications.	
•	Provide	direction	and	qualitative	instructions	about	how	to	approach	design
