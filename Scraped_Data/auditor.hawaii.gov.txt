Report on the Implementation of 
State Auditor’s Recommendations 
2019 – 2022
Report No. 24-09
November 2024
OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
STATE OF HAWAI‘I
A Report to the Governor
and the Legislature of
the State of Hawai‘iPHOTO: OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
STATE OF HAWAI‘I
Constitutional Mandate
Pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the Hawai‘i State Constitution, the
Office of the Auditor shall conduct post-audits of the transactions, accounts, 
programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.
For more information on the Office of the Auditor, visit our website:
https://auditor.hawaii.gov    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024    iThis is a report on the follow-up reviews of implementation by 
state departments and agencies of audit recommendations contained 
in audits issued in calendar years 2019–2022.  We conducted the 
follow-ups pursuant to Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, 
which requires the Auditor to report to the Legislature on each 
recommendation that the Auditor has made that is more than one year 
old and that has not been implemented by the audited agency.
We wish to express our appreciation for the cooperation and 
assistance extended to us by the various audited agencies and others 
whom we contacted during the course of the follow-up reviews.

Status of Implementation of 
Audit Recommendations from 
Reports Issued 2019 – 2022
Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, requires the Auditor to report 
to the Legislature annually on each audit recommendation more than 
one year old that has not been implemented by the audited agency.  Our 
office follows up on recommendations in two ways.  First, on an annual 
basis, we send requests to the agencies for status of implementation of 
our recommendations and details on steps taken toward implementation.  
Second, we conduct an active follow-up two to three years after issuance 
of the audit report containing recommendations and issue a separate 
follow-up report.  Here, we report the latest status on the implementation 
of recommendations made in our reports issued from 2019 to 2022.
Introduction
VERY YEAR, we follow up on recommendations made in our 
audit reports.  We ask agencies to provide us with the status of 
their implementation of the recommendations made as part of 
our audit starting a year after the report was issued.  After two 
or three years, we conduct a more rigorous follow-up review.  Those 
reviews, which we refer to as “active reviews,” include interviewing

WE DEEM  recommendations:
Implemented
  where the department or 
agency provided sufficient 
and appropriate evidence 
to support all elements of 
the recommendation;
Partially Implemented
where some evidence 
was provided but not 
all elements of the 
recommendation were 
addressed;
Not Implemented
  where evidence did 
not support meaningful 
movement towards 
implementation, and/or 
where no evidence was 
provided;  
Not Implemented - N/A
where circumstances 
changed to make a 
recommendation not 
applicable; and
Not Implemented - Disagree
  where the department or 
agency disagreed with the 
recommendation, did not 
intend to implement, and 
no further action will be 
reported.selected personnel from the agency and examining the agency’s relevant 
policies, procedures, records, and documents to assess whether action on 
recommendations has been taken.  Our efforts are limited to reviewing 
and reporting on an agency’s implementation of recommendations made 
in the original audit report.  We do not explore new issues or revisit 
issues from the report unrelated to our original recommendations.
From 2019 to 2022, we made 118 audit recommendations.  Based on 
information self-reported by the agencies and information from active 
reviews, 91 of those recommendations have been partially or fully 
implemented.  
In 2020, we suspended work on ongoing audits so those auditees could 
adjust to performing their work remotely and address COVID-19-related 
issues.  During that time, we performed a series of limited scope reviews 
and financial reporting on pandemic-related issues such as contact 
tracing, reporting of cases, suspension of tax breaks during difficult fiscal 
times, and amounts in special and revolving funds.  These reports were 
specifically applicable to the challenges facing our state in 2020, so any 
recommendations in those reports are not included in our count, and no 
follow-up on the implementation status of recommendations contained in 
those reports was warranted.
We based our scope and methodology on guidelines published by the 
United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) – formerly 
the General Accounting Office – including How to Get Action on Audit 
Recommendations  and Government Auditing Standards , as well as on 
Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS).
According to the GAO, saving tax dollars, improving programs and 
operations, and providing better service to the public represent audit 
work’s “bottom line.”  Recommendations are the vehicles by which these 
objectives are sought.  However, it is action on recommendations – not 
the recommendations themselves – that helps government work better.  
Effective follow-up is essential to realizing the full benefits of audit 
work.    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024    3Audit Recommendations Implementation  
Reports Issued 2019 – 2022
Determining progress  
The time it takes an agency to implement a recommendation depends 
on the type of recommendation.  While some fall fully within the 
purview of an audited agency and can be addressed relatively quickly, 
others may deal with complex problems,  involve multiple agencies, or 
require legislative action, resulting in a  longer implementation period.  
We recognize ample time should be afforded to agencies implementing 
recommendations for a follow-up system to be useful and relevant.
With those observations in mind, we have determined an “active” 
follow-up effort, where we review and assess an agency’s efforts to  
implement our recommendations, is most effective and relevant if 
conducted two to three years after publication of an audit report.  Too 
short an interval between audit report and follow-up might not give 
agencies enough time to implement; too long might allow agencies 
to lose valuable personnel and institutional knowledge needed to 
implement change.  This is consistent with the GAO’s experience that 
action on recommendations usually occurs in the first three years after 
the recommendation is made.
Our current policy is to conduct follow-ups on recommendations for 
a five-year period after issuance of the report.  After this time, further 
action on recommendations is unlikely.  At that point, a new audit may 
be more appropriate.
The following pages present our summaries of the most recent status 
for recommendations from reports issued in the last five years.  In 
many cases, the latest status is based on the agencies’ responses to 
our formal requests for an updated status of implementation of our 
recommendations.
It is important to stress that, unlike our “active” follow-up reports, the 
agencies’ responses to our requests for updates are just that – status as 
reported by the agencies themselves.  Reporting of these responses is 
not based on an independent assessment by our office.  However, the 
responses do represent the most recent status available to us.

REPORT NO. 19-01
Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources’  
Land Conservation Fund
IN REPORT NO. 19-01,  Audit of the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources’ Land Conservation Fund , 
we found that the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources (DLNR) and its Division of Forestry and 
Wildlife (DOFAW) have struggled to properly manage 
the Legacy Land Conservation Program, hampering its 
effectiveness.  We also found that DOFAW sought and/
or obtained funding from the Land Conservation Fund for 
its own projects outside of the Legacy Land Conservation 
Program’s grant award process.
 In 2020 and 2021, we issued formal requests 
for information to DLNR on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-01.  The agency 
reported that 11 of our recommendations had been at least 
partially implemented and one recommendation had not 
been implemented. In 2022, we conducted an active follow-up into the 
implementation of our recommendations and issued Report 
No. 22-11 entitled, Follow-Up on Recommendations from 
Report No. 19-01, Audit of the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources’ Land Conservation Fund .  As a result 
of that report, we found that 8 out of 13 (62%) of our 
recommendations had been at least partially implemented.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to DLNR on the status of audit recommendations noted 
in Report No. 22-11 as “Partially Implemented” or 
“Not Implemented.”  The agency reported that those 
recommendations that they agreed with were now at least 
partially implemented, and the three recommendations not 
implemented they disagreed with.
 The following is a list of recommendations made and a 
chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.  Any findings 
by the Office of the Auditor are highlighted in yellow.

*In Report No. 19-01, we offered 12 recommendations to the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ Legacy Land 
Conservation Program and Commission, including two separate recommendations that were part of Recommendation No. 3.  In the 
follow-up Report No. 22-11, we assessed the program’s implementation of each part of Recommendation No. 3 separately.  For that 
reason, we are now reporting on 13 recommendations (previously 12).Report on the Implementation of State Auditor’s Recommendations 2019 – 20226    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024Recommendation Status of Recommendation

(Program, 3, Part 2.)  DOFAW should  
follow Section 173A-5, HRS, and submit  
a grant application to receive funding 
rather than submit a budgetary request.2022: Auditor reports Not Implemented - Disagree
Follow-Up, Report No. 22-11.
Our follow-up report noted:  “The Legacy Land 
Conservation Program stated its belief that the 
department, on behalf of DOFAW, is allowed to  
submit budgetary requests for the acquisition of 
land and that it therefore disagrees with this part of 
Recommendation 3.  The program further argues that 
the Legislature has shown support for the department  
by appropriating moneys through budgetary requests 
from the Land Conservation Fund for acquisitions.”
2020: DLNR reports Not Implemented - Disagree
Self-reported February 28, 2020, stating:
“…the Department—like many other State agencies—
is authorized to submit a budgetary request for the 
acquisition of interests in land.  As further evidence 
of legislative support for a State agency to submit a 
budgetary request for an appropriation from the Land 
Conservation Fund for resource land acquisition, the 
2019 Legislature appropriated a total of $1,100,000 
from the Land Conservation Fund for two Department 
land acquisitions, as requested by the Department 
through the Executive Budget Request Process.”
(Program, 4.) The Legacy Land 
Conservation Program should work with 
the DLNR fiscal office to request the 
Department of Accounting and General 
Services to return the $684,526 in 
administrative fees erroneously paid to it in 
FY2016 and FY2017.2022: Auditor reports Implemented

Legislature in the program’s annual report 
as required by Section 173A-5(1)(2), HRS.2022: Auditor reports Implemented

(Program, 6.) The Legacy Land 
Conservation Program should review 
personnel spending and position 
assignments and implement changes as 
needed to ensure that Land Conservation 
Fund moneys are used only for 
administrative and other costs directly 
related to the Legacy Land Conservation 
Program.2022: Auditor reports Not Implemented - Disagree
Follow-Up, Report No. 22-11.
Our follow-up report noted:  “The program  
entertained three different alternatives to address 
Recommendation 6...
...
The program justified rejecting these scenarios in  
favor of the status quo in which the Land Conservation 
Fund Program Development Specialist is 100% funded 
from the Land Conservation Fund.  The program based 
its determination on the fact that several individuals 
within the Land Division whose positions are funded 
through sources other than the Land Conservation Fund 
work on Legacy Land Conservation Program activities, 
resulting in ‘well over 1.0 FTE of staff services 
that directly benefit the Legacy Land Conservation 
Program.’”

State, county, or nonprofit organization, 
can remain pending.2022: Auditor reports Not Implemented - Disagree
Follow-Up, Report No. 22-11.

justification for delays, projects can remain active 
indefinitely. ”

Department of the Attorney General, and the Legacy 
Land Conservation Commission to help decide a future 
course of action.”
(Commission, 1.) The Legacy Land 
Conservation Commission should limit the 
amount of the grants that it recommends 
be funded from the Land Conservation 
Fund to the anticipated balance of the

Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ 
Special Land and Development Fund
IN REPORT NO. 19-12,  Audit of the Department 
of Land and Natural Resources’ Special Land and 
Development Fund , we found that the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources’ (DLNR) Land Division is 
lacking in both its management of public lands and its 
administration of the Special Land and Development Fund 
(SLDF).  We found the Land Division does not have a 
strategic plan for the long-term management of its public 
lands, an asset management plan, nor clear and coherent 
policies or procedures to guide day-to-day operations 
and that the absence of long-range planning left staff 
without expertise, resources, or options to actively and 
effectively manage its land portfolio.  We noted DLNR 
does not accurately account for moneys in the SLDF and 
underreported cash balances to the 2018 Legislature by 
more than $1.5 million.  We also reported it has allowed 
more than $1.5 million to sit idle in the SLDF for more 
than five years. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2024, we issued formal 
requests for information to DLNR on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-12.  As of 2024, the 
agency reported that 16 of our recommendations had been 
at least partially implemented, and the one recommendation 
not implemented they disagreed with.

“Land Division presently manages only one multi-
tenanted building under space leases (revocable 
permits), and the Land Board has approved the public 
auction of that property to a master lessee who will 
then manage the spaces.  Land Division would need a 
much larger budget and ceiling to assume the cost of 
maintaining and directly managing improved properties 
in its portfolio, many of which are more than 50 years 
old.  Directly managing such buildings increases the 
State’s exposure to liability for tort claims commonly 
associated with property management (e.g., slip-and-
fall claims).  In recent years, Land Division has been 
unsuccessful in its requests to the Legislature for capital 
improvement funds and even for ceiling increases in 
the expenditure of SLDF monies to invest in State 
properties.  Prospects for obtaining such funds in the 
future are not good.  In addition, the State accounting 
system does not easily accommodate holding accounts 
required for deposit of common area charges from 
tenants to be paid to public utility companies such as for 
water, sewer, electrical and telecommunications.  For 
these reasons, DLNR disagrees that transforming Land 
Division into a space leasing agency is desirable or 
economically feasible.”

Audit of the Department of Education’s Administration of 
School Impact Fees
IN REPORT NO. 19-13,  Audit of the Department of 
Education’ s Administration of School Impact Fees , we 
examined the administration of the school impact fee 
law, which applies to all builders of new residential units 
in designated school impact districts.  The report found 
that the Department of Education (DOE) has no written 
policies and procedures for the selection of potential 
school impact districts, the factors that should be 
considered in determining the size of potential districts, 
or oversight and review of the process.  We reported 
DOE does not begin assessing school impact fees 
immediately upon the Board of Education’s designation 
of a school impact district, sometimes waiting months 
before beginning collection.  We noted DOE has not 
promulgated administrative rules to prescribe the process 
it intends the counties to follow before issuing building 
permits for new residential construction in an impact fee 
district. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we issued formal 
requests for information to DOE on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-13.  The agency 
initially reported that five recommendations had been at 
least partially implemented, 13 recommendations had 
not been implemented, and four recommendations were 
considered moot by the Board of Education and would not 
be implemented.  By their 2023 response, DOE reported 
it had at least partially implemented 13 of the remaining 
recommendations, with five still not implemented.

new residential project should be included 
in the DOE’s consideration of classroom 
capacity requirements.  We found the 
decision to recommend designation of a 
school impact district (and its boundaries) 
was left to the discretion of a land use 
planner who relied heavily on the City and 
County of Honolulu’s vision of transit-
oriented residential development projects 
that were purely conceptual, without 
specific developers, development plans, or 
even land commitments for those projects.

Audit of the Agribusiness Development Corporation
IN REPORT NO. 21-01,  Audit of the Agribusiness 
Development Corporation , we found that the Agribusiness 
Development Corporation (ADC) has done little – if 
anything – to facilitate the development of agricultural 
enterprises to replace the economic loss created by the 
demise of the sugar and pineapple industries.  Instead 
of leading the State’s agricultural transformation, ADC 
primarily manages 4,257 acres of land it started acquiring 
in 2012 as well as the Waiāhole Water System on O‘ahu.  
Yet, we found that the corporation struggles to manage 
its lands, challenged by the myriad duties required for 
effective land management.  We also found that ADC’s 
Board of Directors, as the head of the corporation, has 
provided minimal guidance and oversight of ADC’s 
operations.
 In 2022, we issued a formal request for information 
to ADC on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 21-01.  The agency reported that 26 of our recommendations had been at least partially implemented, 
and the 10 recommendations not implemented they either 
disagreed with or felt were no longer applicable.
 In 2023, we issued another formal request for 
information on the status of audit recommendations.  
The agency reported that 25 of our recommendations 
had been at least partially implemented and 11 had not 
been implemented.  Of the 11 recommendations not 
implemented, the agency disagreed with two, and noted 
that six were no longer applicable.
 In November 2023, we received an update from the 
agency informing us that of the recommendations made to 
ADC, 25 had been implemented and six were no longer 
applicable.  Of the five recommendations made to ADC’s 
Board of Directors, all five had been implemented.
 The following is a list of recommendations made 
and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.

REPORT NO. 22-05
Audit of the Department of Public Safety
IN REPORT NO. 22-05,  Audit of the Department of 
Public Safety , we found that the Department of Public 
Safety (PSD) used an outdated shift relief factor that was 
calculated more than five decades ago.  To determine the 
number of security staff positions (Adult Correctional 
Officers or ACOs) needed to safely operate facilities 
without having to close posts, suspend inmate programs, 
re-assign ACOs, and rely on significant amounts of 
overtime, correctional institutions employ a staffing 
multiplier called a shift relief factor, an important 
metric that accounts for staff absences.  PSD also had 
not developed a process to accurately and consistently 
collect the data needed to calculate the shift relief factor.   
Without an up-to-date and accurate shift relief factor, the 
department does not know the number of ACO positions it 
needs to operate its correctional facilities, and as a result, 
its wardens must routinely resort to “band-aid” solutions 
to cover security posts in their facilities: closing posts, suspending inmate programs, re-assigning staff, and 
excessive overtime.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to PSD on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 22-05.  The agency reported that three of 
our recommendations had been implemented, and one 
recommendation was not implemented.
 In 2024, we issued another formal request for 
information on the status of audit recommendations.  The 
Department of Public Safety was reorganized earlier this 
year, so the request was directed to the Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR).  The agency still 
reported the one recommendation as not implemented.
 The following is a list of recommendations made 
and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.  
Any findings by the Office of the Auditor are highlighted

(1.) The Department should update its shift 
relief factor using actual ACO leave and 
attendance data (instead of calculating 
the shift relief factor based on the amount 
of leave an ACO is legally entitled to 
use).  In addition to when ACOs are out 
on scheduled and unscheduled leave, the 
data should include the number of hours 
(or days) ACOs are unable to work at 
their assigned posts because of required 
training or other temporary reassignments, 
among other things.2024: DCR reports Not Implemented
Self-reported September 7, 2024, stating:
“Consistent with the detailed response dated 7/28/23, it 
remains difficult to determine an effective Shift Relief 
Factor (SRF) when utilizing factors that are unknown 
or not static. As of 6/30/2024, our ACO vacancy 
rate was at 30%, or 70% staffing. We do not have an 
adequate baseline to determine what our actual needs 
are. If a new SRF is formulated which would require a 
request to the legislature for additional staffing, DCR 
continues to believe it would be unreasonable and 
fiscally irresponsible towards the taxpayers of Hawaii 
since we are unable to fill our positions at our current 
SRF of 1.65 per seven (7) day post and 1.25 per five 
(5) day post. DCR continues to believe our SRF needs 
to be evaluated once we are at 90% staffing level to 
more accurately determine the effects on operations 
and proper levels of staffing. In 2024, DCR increased 
recruitment efforts for Adult Corrections Officer (ACO) 
positions and added additional ACO academy classes in 
an effort to increase our staffing levels statewide.”
2023: PSD reports Not Implemented 
Self-reported July 28, 2023, stating:
“The shift relief factor may be better known by utilizing 
this methodology, however the term ‘unscheduled’ will 
be so inconsistent, the changes will bring instability 
in the calculations. Vacancies are also not factored in 
and even if they were, the unpredictability of them will 
distort the data even more since they are not static. It is 
difficult to determine an effective SRF when utilizing 
factors that are unknown or not static.
     PSD is only able to extract data from August of 
2021, that is the date PSD started using the Hawaii 
Information Portal system (HIP) that is now used to 
collect and track time and attendance data. The NIC 
model will require three years of data to formulate the 
SRF.”Report on the Implementation of State Auditor’s Recommendations 2019 – 202250    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024Recommendation Status of Recommendation
(2.) The Department should prioritize the 
collection of accurate and timely ACO leave 
and attendance data needed to calculate an 
accurate and up-to-date shift relief factor 
and communicate that priority as well as 
the purpose and objective of collecting 
the data to correctional facility wardens 
and other department personnel who are 
responsible for the leave and attendance 
data.2023: PSD reports Implemented

(3.) The Department should develop

accurate and up-to-date shift relief factor.2023: PSD reports Implemented
Self-reported July 28, 2023.
(4.) The Department should develop an 
automated process or processes to collect 
and compile the leave and attendance data 
needed to calculate an accurate and up-to-

re-purposes the existing Kamakani tool 
to collect and compile the leave and

Audit of the Office of Language Access
IN REPORT NO. 22-10,  Audit of the Office of Language 
Access , we found that the Office of Language Access 
(OLA) has done little of consequence to address the 
language access needs of limited English proficient 
persons or to ensure meaningful access to services, 
programs, and activities offered by state agencies and 
covered entities.  We found an agency whose efforts to 
review and monitor language access plans, which should 
ensure that agencies have a process through which they 
will provide people who are limited English proficient 
meaningful access to services, programs, and activities, is 
nothing more than a paper exercise.  In addition, OLA’s 
Language Access Resource Center (LARC) is required by 
statute to maintain a publicly available roster of language 
interpreters and translators that includes each individual’s 
qualifications and credentials based on OLA guidelines 
and in consultation with the Language Access Advisory 
Council.  However, the roster maintained by OLA does not include any OLA-approved qualifications and credentials, 
and we found that applicants are not required to show 
proof of their qualifications and competency before they 
are added to the roster.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to OLA on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 22-10.  The agency reported that 19 of our 
recommendations had been at least partially implemented, 
four recommendations were not applicable, and four 
recommendations were not implemented because they 
disagreed.

and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.

“Currently, OLA lacks the capacity and subject

This is because certification is a formal process that 
validates an individual's proficiency and competence in 
language interpretation. It typically involves a rigorous 
assessment of the interpreter's skills, knowledge, and 
ethical understanding of the profession. Certification 
often pertains to specific fields, such as legal, medical, 
or community interpreting.
Therefore, OLA defers this process to more appropriate 
entities, like the National Board of Certification for 
Medical Interpreters (NBCMI) and the Certification 
Commission for Healthcare Interpreters (CCHI), which 
certify medical interpreters, as well as state court 
interpreter certification programs.
Nevertheless, OLA does provide language proficiency

STATE OF HAWAI‘I
Constitutional Mandate
Pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the Hawai‘i State Constitution, the
Office of the Auditor shall conduct post-audits of the transactions, accounts, 
programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.
For more information on the Office of the Auditor, visit our website:
https://auditor.hawaii.gov    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024    iThis is a report on the follow-up reviews of implementation by 
state departments and agencies of audit recommendations contained 
in audits issued in calendar years 2019–2022.  We conducted the 
follow-ups pursuant to Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, 
which requires the Auditor to report to the Legislature on each 
recommendation that the Auditor has made that is more than one year 
old and that has not been implemented by the audited agency.
We wish to express our appreciation for the cooperation and 
assistance extended to us by the various audited agencies and others 
whom we contacted during the course of the follow-up reviews.

Status of Implementation of 
Audit Recommendations from 
Reports Issued 2019 – 2022
Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, requires the Auditor to report 
to the Legislature annually on each audit recommendation more than 
one year old that has not been implemented by the audited agency.  Our 
office follows up on recommendations in two ways.  First, on an annual 
basis, we send requests to the agencies for status of implementation of 
our recommendations and details on steps taken toward implementation.  
Second, we conduct an active follow-up two to three years after issuance 
of the audit report containing recommendations and issue a separate 
follow-up report.  Here, we report the latest status on the implementation 
of recommendations made in our reports issued from 2019 to 2022.
Introduction
VERY YEAR, we follow up on recommendations made in our 
audit reports.  We ask agencies to provide us with the status of 
their implementation of the recommendations made as part of 
our audit starting a year after the report was issued.  After two 
or three years, we conduct a more rigorous follow-up review.  Those 
reviews, which we refer to as “active reviews,” include interviewing

issues.  During that time, we performed a series of limited scope reviews 
and financial reporting on pandemic-related issues such as contact 
tracing, reporting of cases, suspension of tax breaks during difficult fiscal 
times, and amounts in special and revolving funds.  These reports were 
specifically applicable to the challenges facing our state in 2020, so any 
recommendations in those reports are not included in our count, and no 
follow-up on the implementation status of recommendations contained in 
those reports was warranted.
We based our scope and methodology on guidelines published by the 
United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) – formerly 
the General Accounting Office – including How to Get Action on Audit 
Recommendations  and Government Auditing Standards , as well as on 
Section 23-7.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS).
According to the GAO, saving tax dollars, improving programs and 
operations, and providing better service to the public represent audit 
work’s “bottom line.”  Recommendations are the vehicles by which these 
objectives are sought.  However, it is action on recommendations – not 
the recommendations themselves – that helps government work better.  
Effective follow-up is essential to realizing the full benefits of audit 
work.    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024    3Audit Recommendations Implementation  
Reports Issued 2019 – 2022
Determining progress  
The time it takes an agency to implement a recommendation depends 
on the type of recommendation.  While some fall fully within the 
purview of an audited agency and can be addressed relatively quickly, 
others may deal with complex problems,  involve multiple agencies, or 
require legislative action, resulting in a  longer implementation period.  
We recognize ample time should be afforded to agencies implementing 
recommendations for a follow-up system to be useful and relevant.
With those observations in mind, we have determined an “active” 
follow-up effort, where we review and assess an agency’s efforts to  
implement our recommendations, is most effective and relevant if 
conducted two to three years after publication of an audit report.  Too 
short an interval between audit report and follow-up might not give 
agencies enough time to implement; too long might allow agencies 
to lose valuable personnel and institutional knowledge needed to 
implement change.  This is consistent with the GAO’s experience that 
action on recommendations usually occurs in the first three years after 
the recommendation is made.
Our current policy is to conduct follow-ups on recommendations for 
a five-year period after issuance of the report.  After this time, further 
action on recommendations is unlikely.  At that point, a new audit may 
be more appropriate.
The following pages present our summaries of the most recent status 
for recommendations from reports issued in the last five years.  In 
many cases, the latest status is based on the agencies’ responses to 
our formal requests for an updated status of implementation of our 
recommendations.
It is important to stress that, unlike our “active” follow-up reports, the 
agencies’ responses to our requests for updates are just that – status as 
reported by the agencies themselves.  Reporting of these responses is 
not based on an independent assessment by our office.  However, the 
responses do represent the most recent status available to us.

REPORT NO. 19-01
Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources’  
Land Conservation Fund
IN REPORT NO. 19-01,  Audit of the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources’ Land Conservation Fund , 
we found that the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources (DLNR) and its Division of Forestry and 
Wildlife (DOFAW) have struggled to properly manage 
the Legacy Land Conservation Program, hampering its 
effectiveness.  We also found that DOFAW sought and/
or obtained funding from the Land Conservation Fund for 
its own projects outside of the Legacy Land Conservation 
Program’s grant award process.
 In 2020 and 2021, we issued formal requests 
for information to DLNR on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-01.  The agency 
reported that 11 of our recommendations had been at least 
partially implemented and one recommendation had not 
been implemented. In 2022, we conducted an active follow-up into the 
implementation of our recommendations and issued Report 
No. 22-11 entitled, Follow-Up on Recommendations from 
Report No. 19-01, Audit of the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources’ Land Conservation Fund .  As a result 
of that report, we found that 8 out of 13 (62%) of our 
recommendations had been at least partially implemented.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to DLNR on the status of audit recommendations noted 
in Report No. 22-11 as “Partially Implemented” or 
“Not Implemented.”  The agency reported that those 
recommendations that they agreed with were now at least 
partially implemented, and the three recommendations not 
implemented they disagreed with.
 The following is a list of recommendations made and a 
chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.  Any findings 
by the Office of the Auditor are highlighted in yellow.

Our follow-up report noted:  “The Legacy Land 
Conservation Program stated its belief that the 
department, on behalf of DOFAW, is allowed to  
submit budgetary requests for the acquisition of 
land and that it therefore disagrees with this part of 
Recommendation 3.  The program further argues that 
the Legislature has shown support for the department

The program justified rejecting these scenarios in  
favor of the status quo in which the Land Conservation

Audit of the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ 
Special Land and Development Fund
IN REPORT NO. 19-12,  Audit of the Department 
of Land and Natural Resources’ Special Land and 
Development Fund , we found that the Department of 
Land and Natural Resources’ (DLNR) Land Division is 
lacking in both its management of public lands and its 
administration of the Special Land and Development Fund 
(SLDF).  We found the Land Division does not have a 
strategic plan for the long-term management of its public 
lands, an asset management plan, nor clear and coherent 
policies or procedures to guide day-to-day operations 
and that the absence of long-range planning left staff 
without expertise, resources, or options to actively and 
effectively manage its land portfolio.  We noted DLNR 
does not accurately account for moneys in the SLDF and 
underreported cash balances to the 2018 Legislature by 
more than $1.5 million.  We also reported it has allowed 
more than $1.5 million to sit idle in the SLDF for more 
than five years. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2024, we issued formal 
requests for information to DLNR on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-12.  As of 2024, the 
agency reported that 16 of our recommendations had been 
at least partially implemented, and the one recommendation 
not implemented they disagreed with.

Self-reported July 27, 2021, stating:
“Land Division presently manages only one multi-
tenanted building under space leases (revocable 
permits), and the Land Board has approved the public 
auction of that property to a master lessee who will 
then manage the spaces.  Land Division would need a 
much larger budget and ceiling to assume the cost of 
maintaining and directly managing improved properties 
in its portfolio, many of which are more than 50 years 
old.  Directly managing such buildings increases the 
State’s exposure to liability for tort claims commonly 
associated with property management (e.g., slip-and-
fall claims).  In recent years, Land Division has been 
unsuccessful in its requests to the Legislature for capital 
improvement funds and even for ceiling increases in 
the expenditure of SLDF monies to invest in State 
properties.  Prospects for obtaining such funds in the 
future are not good.  In addition, the State accounting 
system does not easily accommodate holding accounts 
required for deposit of common area charges from 
tenants to be paid to public utility companies such as for 
water, sewer, electrical and telecommunications.  For 
these reasons, DLNR disagrees that transforming Land 
Division into a space leasing agency is desirable or 
economically feasible.”

REPORT NO. 19-13
Audit of the Department of Education’s Administration of 
School Impact Fees
IN REPORT NO. 19-13,  Audit of the Department of 
Education’ s Administration of School Impact Fees , we 
examined the administration of the school impact fee 
law, which applies to all builders of new residential units 
in designated school impact districts.  The report found 
that the Department of Education (DOE) has no written 
policies and procedures for the selection of potential 
school impact districts, the factors that should be 
considered in determining the size of potential districts, 
or oversight and review of the process.  We reported 
DOE does not begin assessing school impact fees 
immediately upon the Board of Education’s designation 
of a school impact district, sometimes waiting months 
before beginning collection.  We noted DOE has not 
promulgated administrative rules to prescribe the process 
it intends the counties to follow before issuing building 
permits for new residential construction in an impact fee 
district. In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, we issued formal 
requests for information to DOE on the status of audit 
recommendations from Report No. 19-13.  The agency 
initially reported that five recommendations had been at 
least partially implemented, 13 recommendations had 
not been implemented, and four recommendations were 
considered moot by the Board of Education and would not 
be implemented.  By their 2023 response, DOE reported 
it had at least partially implemented 13 of the remaining 
recommendations, with five still not implemented.
 The following is a list of recommendations made 
and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.  Any 
findings by the Office of the Auditor are highlighted in

(DOE, 1.) The Department of Education 
should undertake a comprehensive 
evaluation of its implementation and 
administration of the school impact fee law, 
including an assessment of the appropriate 
staffing and other resources necessary to 
implement and administer the law.2021: DOE reports Implemented

Self-reported October 30, 2020, stating:
“A comprehensive evaluation of the school impact fee 
program commenced in February 2020, with the hiring of 
a new Assistant Superintendent for the Office of Facilities 
and Operations.  A preliminary evaluation and situation 
analysis by the planning department of the Office of 
Facilities and Operations (OFO) were made available to 
the Assistant Superintendent in October 2020.
Effective November 30, 2020, the OFO will initiate the 
development of a comprehensive plan for the school 
impact fee program.”
(DOE, 2.a.) The Department of Education 
should create written policies and 
procedures to guide and direct staff’s 
and management’s implementation and 
administration of the school impact fee 
law.  Documented policies and procedures 
are some of the controls necessary for 
the DOE to ensure effective and efficient 
implementation and administration of 
the law in accordance with the statute, 
legislative intent, and constitutional 
requirements.  At minimum, policies and 
procedures should address the stage in the 
development process at which a proposed 
new residential project should be included 
in the DOE’s consideration of classroom 
capacity requirements.  We found the 
decision to recommend designation of a 
school impact district (and its boundaries) 
was left to the discretion of a land use 
planner who relied heavily on the City and 
County of Honolulu’s vision of transit-
oriented residential development projects 
that were purely conceptual, without 
specific developers, development plans, or 
even land commitments for those projects.  
The policies and procedures should 
include criteria and other objective factors 
to be considered in evaluating when 
designation of a school impact district is 
appropriate.2021: DOE reports Implemented

and procedures should address the 
factors that determine the size and 
composition of a proposed impact fee 
district.  Without a consistent process 
or documented framework, some of 
the department’s district designations 
appear questionable or even arbitrary: 
For instance, the expansive and diverse 
Leeward O‘ahu district encompasses 
five school complexes (41 schools) with 
varying rates of past and projected student 
enrollment growth.  Meanwhile, the KAM 
district boundaries are based on smaller 
elementary school service areas; as a 
result, the impact fee district includes only 
10 of the 15 elementary schools in the 
Farrington and McKinley complexes.2021: DOE reports Implemented

fees collected within an impact fee district 
can be spent only within the same district.  
We found that, with only one exception, 
the impact fee districts designated by the 
Board of Education encompass multiple 
school complexes.  We raised concerns 
about whether the DOE can use school 
impact fees from a specific development 
in a school complex within the same

additional public school students created

Audit of the Agribusiness Development Corporation
IN REPORT NO. 21-01,  Audit of the Agribusiness 
Development Corporation , we found that the Agribusiness 
Development Corporation (ADC) has done little – if 
anything – to facilitate the development of agricultural 
enterprises to replace the economic loss created by the 
demise of the sugar and pineapple industries.  Instead 
of leading the State’s agricultural transformation, ADC 
primarily manages 4,257 acres of land it started acquiring 
in 2012 as well as the Waiāhole Water System on O‘ahu.  
Yet, we found that the corporation struggles to manage 
its lands, challenged by the myriad duties required for 
effective land management.  We also found that ADC’s 
Board of Directors, as the head of the corporation, has 
provided minimal guidance and oversight of ADC’s 
operations.
 In 2022, we issued a formal request for information 
to ADC on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 21-01.  The agency reported that 26 of our recommendations had been at least partially implemented, 
and the 10 recommendations not implemented they either 
disagreed with or felt were no longer applicable.
 In 2023, we issued another formal request for 
information on the status of audit recommendations.  
The agency reported that 25 of our recommendations 
had been at least partially implemented and 11 had not 
been implemented.  Of the 11 recommendations not 
implemented, the agency disagreed with two, and noted 
that six were no longer applicable.
 In November 2023, we received an update from the 
agency informing us that of the recommendations made to 
ADC, 25 had been implemented and six were no longer 
applicable.  Of the five recommendations made to ADC’s 
Board of Directors, all five had been implemented.
 The following is a list of recommendations made 
and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.  
Any findings by the Office of the Auditor are highlighted

REPORT NO. 22-05
Audit of the Department of Public Safety
IN REPORT NO. 22-05,  Audit of the Department of 
Public Safety , we found that the Department of Public 
Safety (PSD) used an outdated shift relief factor that was 
calculated more than five decades ago.  To determine the 
number of security staff positions (Adult Correctional 
Officers or ACOs) needed to safely operate facilities 
without having to close posts, suspend inmate programs, 
re-assign ACOs, and rely on significant amounts of 
overtime, correctional institutions employ a staffing 
multiplier called a shift relief factor, an important 
metric that accounts for staff absences.  PSD also had 
not developed a process to accurately and consistently 
collect the data needed to calculate the shift relief factor.   
Without an up-to-date and accurate shift relief factor, the 
department does not know the number of ACO positions it 
needs to operate its correctional facilities, and as a result, 
its wardens must routinely resort to “band-aid” solutions 
to cover security posts in their facilities: closing posts, suspending inmate programs, re-assigning staff, and 
excessive overtime.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to PSD on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 22-05.  The agency reported that three of 
our recommendations had been implemented, and one 
recommendation was not implemented.
 In 2024, we issued another formal request for 
information on the status of audit recommendations.  The 
Department of Public Safety was reorganized earlier this 
year, so the request was directed to the Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation (DCR).  The agency still 
reported the one recommendation as not implemented.
 The following is a list of recommendations made 
and a chronological summary of our follow-up efforts.

(1.) The Department should update its shift 
relief factor using actual ACO leave and 
attendance data (instead of calculating 
the shift relief factor based on the amount 
of leave an ACO is legally entitled to 
use).  In addition to when ACOs are out 
on scheduled and unscheduled leave, the 
data should include the number of hours 
(or days) ACOs are unable to work at 
their assigned posts because of required 
training or other temporary reassignments, 
among other things.2024: DCR reports Not Implemented
Self-reported September 7, 2024, stating:
“Consistent with the detailed response dated 7/28/23, it 
remains difficult to determine an effective Shift Relief 
Factor (SRF) when utilizing factors that are unknown 
or not static. As of 6/30/2024, our ACO vacancy 
rate was at 30%, or 70% staffing. We do not have an 
adequate baseline to determine what our actual needs 
are. If a new SRF is formulated which would require a 
request to the legislature for additional staffing, DCR 
continues to believe it would be unreasonable and 
fiscally irresponsible towards the taxpayers of Hawaii 
since we are unable to fill our positions at our current 
SRF of 1.65 per seven (7) day post and 1.25 per five 
(5) day post. DCR continues to believe our SRF needs 
to be evaluated once we are at 90% staffing level to 
more accurately determine the effects on operations 
and proper levels of staffing. In 2024, DCR increased 
recruitment efforts for Adult Corrections Officer (ACO) 
positions and added additional ACO academy classes in 
an effort to increase our staffing levels statewide.”
2023: PSD reports Not Implemented 
Self-reported July 28, 2023, stating:
“The shift relief factor may be better known by utilizing 
this methodology, however the term ‘unscheduled’ will 
be so inconsistent, the changes will bring instability 
in the calculations. Vacancies are also not factored in 
and even if they were, the unpredictability of them will 
distort the data even more since they are not static. It is 
difficult to determine an effective SRF when utilizing 
factors that are unknown or not static.
     PSD is only able to extract data from August of 
2021, that is the date PSD started using the Hawaii 
Information Portal system (HIP) that is now used to 
collect and track time and attendance data. The NIC 
model will require three years of data to formulate the 
SRF.”Report on the Implementation of State Auditor’s Recommendations 2019 – 202250    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024Recommendation Status of Recommendation
(2.) The Department should prioritize the 
collection of accurate and timely ACO leave 
and attendance data needed to calculate an 
accurate and up-to-date shift relief factor 
and communicate that priority as well as 
the purpose and objective of collecting 
the data to correctional facility wardens 
and other department personnel who are 
responsible for the leave and attendance 
data.2023: PSD reports Implemented
Self-reported July 28, 2023.
(3.) The Department should develop 
policies, procedures, and processes to 
ensure each correctional facility operated 
by the department collects and compiles 
complete and consistent time and 
attendance data necessary to compute an 
accurate and up-to-date shift relief factor.2023: PSD reports Implemented
Self-reported July 28, 2023.
(4.) The Department should develop an 
automated process or processes to collect 
and compile the leave and attendance data 
needed to calculate an accurate and up-to-
date shift relief factor.  If the department 
re-purposes the existing Kamakani tool 
to collect and compile the leave and 
attendance data needed to compute its 
shift relief factor, we recommend that the 
department consider Kamakani to be an 
interim measure to determine its actual 
staffing requirements.  An automated 
process or processes is needed to replace 
the current process or processes that 
require department personnel to manually 
copy and input leave and attendance 
information from certain forms to other 
forms.2023: PSD reports Implemented

Audit of the Office of Language Access
IN REPORT NO. 22-10,  Audit of the Office of Language 
Access , we found that the Office of Language Access 
(OLA) has done little of consequence to address the 
language access needs of limited English proficient 
persons or to ensure meaningful access to services, 
programs, and activities offered by state agencies and 
covered entities.  We found an agency whose efforts to 
review and monitor language access plans, which should 
ensure that agencies have a process through which they 
will provide people who are limited English proficient 
meaningful access to services, programs, and activities, is 
nothing more than a paper exercise.  In addition, OLA’s 
Language Access Resource Center (LARC) is required by 
statute to maintain a publicly available roster of language 
interpreters and translators that includes each individual’s 
qualifications and credentials based on OLA guidelines 
and in consultation with the Language Access Advisory 
Council.  However, the roster maintained by OLA does not include any OLA-approved qualifications and credentials, 
and we found that applicants are not required to show 
proof of their qualifications and competency before they 
are added to the roster.
 In 2023, we issued a formal request for information 
to OLA on the status of audit recommendations from 
Report No. 22-10.  The agency reported that 19 of our 
recommendations had been at least partially implemented, 
four recommendations were not applicable, and four 
recommendations were not implemented because they

is unique, possessing different levels of resources. 
Therefore, it is more appropriate for each agency 
to assess its own resources and costs related to the 
implementation of Language Access Plans.”    Report No. 24-09 / November 2024    57Recommendation Status of Recommendation
(1.c.v.) The Office of Language Access 
should adopt administrative rules that 
implement and interpret the language 
access law, Chapter 321C, HRS, prescribing 
the procedures and requirements agencies 
and covered entities must follow to 
comply with the statute.  Specifically, the 
administrative rules should include the 
following regarding the implementation 
of Language Access Plans:  The time by 
which state agencies and covered entities 
must provide written translation of vital 
documents to limited English proficient

Self-reported November 30, 2023, stating:
“Under §321C-3, HRS, each entity is required to 
take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access 
to services, programs, and activities for persons 
with limited English proficiency (LEP). However, 
defining ‘reasonable steps’ precisely and inclusively is 
challenging due to its subjective nature. The appropriate 
measures largely depend on the specific circumstances 
encountered at the time.
In line with this, as a critical element of the language 
access plan, §11-220-8(e) of the draft HARs mandates 
that agencies address all components related to written 
language services. This provision aims to ensure that 
agencies are well-prepared and can respond effectively 
when situations require the provision of written 
language services or alternative modes of access for 
LEP individuals.”

Self-reported November 30, 2023, stating:
“Currently, OLA lacks the capacity and subject 
matter expertise to become a credentialing body 
for certifying language interpreters and translators. 
This is because certification is a formal process that 
validates an individual's proficiency and competence in 
language interpretation. It typically involves a rigorous 
assessment of the interpreter's skills, knowledge, and 
ethical understanding of the profession. Certification 
often pertains to specific fields, such as legal, medical, 
or community interpreting.
Therefore, OLA defers this process to more appropriate 
entities, like the National Board of Certification for 
Medical Interpreters (NBCMI) and the Certification 
Commission for Healthcare Interpreters (CCHI), which 
certify medical interpreters, as well as state court 
interpreter certification programs.
Nevertheless, OLA does provide language proficiency 
tests as a basic foundation for those interested in 
becoming language service providers and offers 
periodic skill-building training to enhance the abilities 
of current providers.”

Pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the Hawai‘i State Constitution, the
Office of the Auditor shall conduct post-audits of the transactions, accounts, 
programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the Governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.

Introduction
This review encompasses the special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, 
and trust accounts administered by the State of Hawai‘i Department of 
Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).  Section 23-12, Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes (HRS), requires the Auditor to review each state department’s 
special, revolving, and trust funds every five years.  Although not 
mandated by Section 23-12, HRS, we have included trust accounts as 
part of our review.  Trust accounts, like special, revolving, and trust 
funds, are funded outside of the General Fund appropriation process and 
are therefore generally subject to less legislative scrutiny than the State’ s 
General Fund.  For each fund and account, our review included: 
1. An evaluation of the original intent and purpose of the fund or 
account, both as expressed by the Legislature and as understood 
by the expending agency;  
2. The degree to which the fund or account achieves its stated and 
claimed purposes;
3. An evaluation of the fund or account’s performance standards as 
established by the agency; and 
4. A summary statement reflecting total fund transactions in 
the preceding five fiscal years, including the fund or account 
balance at the beginning of each fiscal year, total deposits and 
withdrawals, amount of interest earned, total expenditures made 
from the fund or account, and the ending balance for each fiscal 
year.
This is our seventh review of DLNR’s revolving funds, trust funds, and 
trust accounts.1  It is our third review of DLNR’s special funds since 
Act 130, Session Laws of Hawai‘i (SLH) 2013, amended Section 23-12, 
HRS, to require review of special funds along with revolving funds and 
trust funds.  We last examined these funds and accounts in 2018. 
1 Prior to 2013, Section 23-12, HRS, did not require reviews of departm ents’ special funds.2    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 1:  IntroductionSection 37-62, HRS, defines a special fund as one that is “dedicated 
or set aside by law for a specified object or purpose, but excluding 
revolving funds and trust funds.”  According to the State’s  Accounting 
Manual , special funds are funds used to account for revenues earmarked 
for particular purposes and from which expenditures are made for those 
purposes.
Section 37-62, HRS, defines a revolving fund as one “from which is 
paid the cost of goods and services rendered or furnished to or by a state 
agency and which is replenished through charges made for the goods or 
services or through transfers from other accounts or funds.”  Activities 
commonly financed through revolving funds include loan programs, 
which are initially established by general fund seed moneys and are then 
replenished through the repayment of loans.
Section 37-62, HRS, defines a trust fund as one in which “designated 
persons or classes of persons have a vested beneficial interest or 
equitable ownership, or which was created or established by a gift, 
grant, contribution, devise or bequest that limits the use of the fund 
to designated objects or purposes.”   Trust funds invoke a fiduciary 
responsibility of state government to care for and use the assets held 
only for those designated to benefit from the funds.  A pension fund is 
an example of a trust fund.  Contributions and payments are to be held 
for the beneficiaries of the pension fund.  Another example is tenants’ 
security deposits, which are held in trust for the future benefit of tenants 
and landlords.  Until forfeited or returned, deposits are the property of 
the tenants and should be accounted for accordingly.
The Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) defines a 
trust account as a separate holding or clearing account for state agencies.  
Trust accounts also serve as accounting devices to credit or charge 
agencies or projects for payroll or other costs. Description of

In 2002, the Legislature set the requirements for establishing and 
continuing special and revolving funds.  Sections 37-52.3 and 37-52.4, 
HRS, state that special and revolving funds may only be established by 
statute.   The criteria used to review special and revolving funds are the 
extent to which each fund:
• Serves a need, as demonstrated by: (a) the purpose of the 
program to be supported by the fund; (b) the scope of the 
program, including financial information on fees to be charged, 
sources of projected revenue, and costs; and (c) an explanation of 
why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the 
General Fund appropriation process;
• Reflects a clear nexus between the benefits sought and charges 
made upon the program users or beneficiaries, or a clear link 
between the program and the sources of revenue – as opposed 
to serving primarily as a means to provide the program or users 
with an automatic means of support removed from the normal 
budget and appropriation process;
• Provides an appropriate means of financing for the program 
or activity that is used only when essential to the successful 
operation of the program or activity; and
• Demonstrates the capacity to be financially self-sustaining.  Criteria for 
Reviewing Special 
Funds, Revolving 
Funds, Trust 
Funds, and Trust 
Accounts
Special and revolving
fund criteria4    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 1:  IntroductionUnlike the requirements for special and revolving funds, the law is silent 
on whether a trust fund or trust account must be established by statute.  
The criteria used in this report to review trust funds and trust accounts 
are the extent to which the fund or account:
• Continues to serve the purpose and intent for which it was 
originally created, and 
• Meets the definition of a trust fund or trust account, respectively .
 
The first criterion is derived from the objectives of Section 23-12, HRS, 
which requires the Auditor to evaluate the original intent of each fund 
and account and the degree to which each fund and account achieves its 
stated purpose.  The second criterion assesses whether a fund is held by 
the State only for the benefit of those with a vested interest in the assets 
or an account is held as a separate or clearing account.
1. Identify and review all special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, 
and trust accounts of DLNR.
2. For each special fund, revolving fund, trust fund, and trust account, 
determine whether the fund or account meets the respective criteria. 
3. Provide a five-year (FY2019 – FY2023) unaudited financial 
summary for each fund and account of DLNR.
We reviewed all special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, and trust 
accounts administered by DLNR during the five-year period under 
review (FY2019 – FY2023).  Funds and accounts included those 
established by statute as well as by administrative authority.
To identify funds subject to this review, we used a variety of sources, 
including our prior reviews, accounting reports from DAGS, non-general 
fund reports, legislative budget briefing documents, and other records.  
To gain an understanding of fund operations, we reviewed applicable 
agency administrative rules and interviewed key fiscal and program 
personnel, as necessary. 
We obtained a summary statement for each fund that reflects total 
fund transactions in the preceding five fiscal years (July 1, 2018 to 
June 30, 2023), including beginning fund balances, total revenues, 
amount of interest earned, total expenditures, transfers, and ending 
fund balances for each fiscal year.   We requested explanations for Scope and

discrepancies between ending balances for FY2018 reported in our last 
review and opening balances reported for FY2019.  We did not audit the 
department’s financial data, which we provide for informational purposes 
only. 
Procedures were performed on each fund using relevant criteria as stated 
above.  We reviewed fund information for consistency with the intent 
of each fund’s use and to ascertain the relationship between charges 
on users and expenditures.  We reviewed information on performance 
standards established for the funds or accounts and performed other 
procedures as necessary. 
Where appropriate, we relied on our prior reports, including Report  
No. 18-19,  Review of Special Funds, Revolving Funds, Trust Funds, and 
Trust Accounts of the Department of Land and Natural Resources . 
Our review was conducted from August 2023 to April 2024.

Fund Summary
Account Type Trust fund
How was the fund created? Administratively established (2007)
Why was it created?The fund was used to assist the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) with managing  
the Wao Kele O Puna Forest Reserve on the island of Hawai‘i as part of a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between OHA and the department.  According 
to the department, the MOA ended in FY2018, the remaining funds were returned 
to OHA in FY2019.  The fund’s current balance is the interest received by the 
department after the fund balance had been returned to OHA in FY2019.  The 
department intends to transfer the residual balance to the State Treasury and close 
the fund when it meets the required period of inactivity.
Fund meets criteria?This fund does not meet all the criteria of a trust fund.  The fund should be closed 
because it no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally established.
Performance standards No, the fund does not have performance standards.
RevenuesRevenues are from interest.  In Report No. 18-19, revenues were initially from 
transfers from OHA; however, the last transfer from OHA was in FY2013.
ExpendituresExpenditures include a return of funds to OHA in FY2019 after the MOA ended.  
There were no other expenditures during our review.

Fund Summary
Account Type Special fund
How was the fund created? Act 351 (SLH 1987)
Why was it created?The fund was originally created to be used for the identification, establishment, 
and management of natural area reserves; the acquisition of private lands for new 
natural area reserves; the operation of the Heritage Program; and the provision of 
matching funds for the Natural Area Partnership Program.  However, the programs 
are now primarily supported by the General Fund appropriation process and 
the fund is meant to primarily collect parking fees at ‘Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural Area 
Reserve to supplement visitor management.
Fund meets criteria?This fund does not meet the criteria of a special fund because it no longer serves 
the purpose for which it was originally established and the programs that the fund 
was created to support are now funded through the General Fund appropriation 
process.  Therefore, the fund should be repealed .
Performance standards No, the fund does not have performance standards.
RevenuesThe original source of revenue was 25 percent of the State’s conveyance tax 
pursuant to Act 195 (SLH 1993).  However, Act 84 (SLH 2015) eliminated the 
conveyance tax as the fund’s primary source of revenue and general funds were 
appropriated to support the program.  DLNR stated current revenues consist of 
parking fees collected at the Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural Area Reserve and interest.  We 
note no parking fees were collected during the period under review .
ExpendituresExpenditures include costs to support visitor management at ‘Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural 
Area Reserve.  However, FY2019 and FY2021 expenditures include transfers 
to the General Fund pursuant to Act 12 (SLH 2018) and Act 87 (SLH 2021),

to the same level of legislative scrutiny as the General Fund.  Accurate 
and complete reporting of all funds, as required by law, would greatly 
improve the Legislature’s oversight and control of these funds and 
provide increased budgetary flexibility.  Fund reports are one of the 
primary means through which the Legislature tracks non-general funds.  
The reports are used to monitor fund balances and identify excess 
moneys for possible transfer to the General Fund.
Non-General Funds Were Not Reported as Required by Law
Section 37-47, HRS, requires departments to submit to the Legislature an 
annual report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as the intended purpose of the fund, current program activities 
supported by the fund, and financial data.  The Director of Finance 
annually issues a memorandum requesting all departments complete and 
submit Form 37-47, Report on Non-General Fund Information , to the 
Department of Land and Natural Resources for each of their non-general 
funds.  The Department of Land and Natural Resources compiles a report 
of all non-general fund accounts and submits it to the Legislature prior to 
the start of each legislative session.
Section 37-48, HRS, enacted by the Legislature through Act 87 in 2021, 
requires departments to submit to the Legislature an annual program 
measures report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as program objectives, program activities, metrics for target 
population, and metrics for assessing effectiveness over the ensuing six 
fiscal years.  The report must be filed no later than October 1 annually.
Section 37-49, HRS, also enacted by the Legislature through Act 87 in 
2021, requires departments to submit to the Legislature an annual cost 
element report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as budget details by cost element and non-general fund names and 
account codes for each item or object code.  The report must be filed no 
later than October 1 annually.
Section 37-52.5, HRS, requires the Judiciary and any department that 
administratively establishes a new fund or account to submit a report 
to the Legislature.  The report must be filed within 30  working days of 
a fund or account’s creation and should include a justification for the Chapter 3

prior to the start of each legislative session, the law also requires each 
department to submit to the Legislature a listing of all administratively 
established funds or accounts along with a statement of their revenues, 
expenditures, encumbrances, and ending balances for each fund or 
account.  This report is separate from the non-general fund report

the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources’ Comments
WE TRANSMITTED  a draft of this review to the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (DLNR) on August 19, 2024.  We received DLNR’s 
formal response to the draft report, which is attached in its entirety 
as Attachment 1, on September 3, 2024.  DLNR concurred with our 
recommendations for reclassifications and/or closure for two trust funds 
and two trust accounts and will consider our recommendations for two 
special funds after further review.
We reported that a special fund, Forest Stewardship Fund, did not meet 
the criteria of a special fund.  DLNR stated that the fund is necessary 
to be used to separate revenues from the harvest of non-native forest 
products from the forest reserves.  The fund was statutorily established 
pursuant to Section 195F-4(a)(1), HRS, which states that payments from 
the fund, “shall be made by the board pursuant to agreements entered 
into with qualified landowners to further the purposes of this chapter .”  
During our review, we noted that while the funds are being used for other 
purposes as laid out in Section 195F-4, HRS, the fund is not being used 
to make payments to landowners as intended.  Therefore, we maintain 
that this fund does not meet the special fund criteria as it is no longer 
used for the purpose for which it was established.
We reported that a trust account, Land Division – Water Monitoring 
Services, did not meet the criteria of a trust account.  The Department 
of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) defines a trust account as 
a separate holding or clearing account for state agencies.  While DLNR 
agreed to reclassify the trust account as a trust fund as we recommended, 
they stated that the account has been used as a clearing account for 
certain holders of revocable permits for use of State waters and for 
stream gauging services provided by the United States Geological Survey 
(USGS).  As DLNR is making payments to USGS on behalf of revocable 
permit holders, both of whom are not state agencies, we maintain 
that this trust account functions more like a trust fund and should be 
reclassified as such.
DLNR acknowledged our findings that two funds were not reported 
pursuant to Section 37-47, HRS, and will take appropriate measures to 
ensure compliance.Response to 
Agency CommentsOffice of the Auditor’s Response to the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ Comments
66    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024DLNR disagreed with our findings noting that most trust funds and trust 
accounts were not reported pursuant to Section 37-48, HRS, based on 
how the funds are used in these accounts.  DLNR stated that funds in 
these accounts cannot be measured for effectiveness and there are no 
program size indicators.  Section 37-48, HRS, requires departments to 
submit to the Legislature an annual program measures report of each 
non-general fund account.  Section 37-48, HRS, does not include any 
exceptions to the reporting requirement based on fund type.
DLNR also disagreed with our findings regarding reporting requirements 
pursuant to Section 37-49, HRS, as all non-reported funds are 
unbudgeted, and therefore, there are no budget details by cost elements.  
Section 37-49, HRS, requires departments to submit to the Legislature 
an annual cost element report of each non-general fund account.  
Section 37-49, HRS, does not include any exceptions to the reporting 
requirement based on budget status of funds or accounts.
DLNR concurred with our findings regarding two funds that were  
not reported pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.  However, DLNR stated 
that both funds were established years ago, and it did not think it was still 
necessary to file this report.  DLNR noted that the funds were included in 
the annual submission of Non-General Fund Reports.  Section 37-52.5, 
HRS, requires the Judiciary and any department that administratively 
establishes a new fund or account to submit a report to the Legislature.  
In addition, it requires each department to submit to the Legislature a 
listing of all administratively established funds or accounts along with 
a statement of their revenues, expenditures, encumbrances, and ending 
balances for each fund or account prior to the start of each legislative 
session.  This report is separate from the non-general fund report 
required under Section 37-47, HRS.  Therefore, we maintain that the 
funds identified in Exhibit 3.1 of our report were required to be reported 
pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.
DLNR also noted that the Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave Trust Fund 
was not filed pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS, because it was not 
administratively created and believes it was statutorily created per  
Act 119 (SLH 2015), Item A-23.  Act 119 (SLH 2015) is the budget 
bill for the state and Item A-23 establishes an appropriation but did 
not establish the fund.  In our prior reviews, we have reported it as 
administratively established.  Act 10 (SLH 2015) reclassified the fund 
from a revolving fund to a trust fund and stated, “The legislature finds 
that while the administratively established fund meets the purpose for 
which it was established, it does not meet the criteria for a revolving 
fund and that reclassifying it as a trust fund would be more appropriate.”  
Therefore, we maintain that the fund was administratively established 
and was required to be reported pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    67DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Dear Mr. Kondo:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your report entitled Review of Special Funds, 
Revolving Funds, Trust Funds, and Trust Accounts of the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources .  We have reviewed the draft report and offer the following comments:
Fund(s) Not Meeting Criteria

interest received from the State Investment Pool Account and will be transferred to the

Conservation and Resources Enforcement Special Fund (S-302-C)
The DLNR has requested a ceiling increase during the last legislative session to use the 
funds to help with the recovery efforts related to the Maui wildfire disaster that began on 
August 8, 2023.  The Department is in the process of requesting for an expenditure ceiling 
by way of the Major Disaster Funds (MDF).ATTACHMENT 1ATTACHMENT 1

fund.  Although it should be noted that at the last review, the account was classified as a 
trust account and the Department was not informed that the classification was not correct. 
 Forest Stewardship Fund (S-347-C) 
During the 2015 legislative session, a portion of the conveyance taxes deposited to this 
account was repealed by the Legislature.  The conveyance tax distribution was replaced 
by general funds and special fund sources.  The special funds are coming from this account 
and from the Special Land and Development Fund (SLDF), per Sequence No. 3003-001, 
of Act 119, SLH 2015. 
This account gets its revenue from forest product sales, and fines or penalties for violations 
related to respecting boundaries and following laws of land stewardship are reinvested to 
sustain these types of activities and the broader management of the forest reserves.  The 
forest stewardship fund is essential to financially sustain certain activities within the Forest 
Reserve System.  All costs paid from the fund are for support of the management of the 
Forest Reserved System and the forest stewardship program.   
This account is necessary to separate revenues directly received from the harvest of non-
native forest products from forest reserves, from the harvest of native forest products from 
degraded forests as defined in Section 186-5.5, HRS, within forest reserves, from forest 
products found dead and lying on the ground, from the sale of tree seedlings from the State 
nurseries, the sale of any other products or services, or anything of value derived from 
forest reserves, or the imposition of fines or penalties from violations per Sections 195F, 
183, and 185, HRS. 
An account was also established to separate the funding from SLDF.  This is to show that 
this account is a sub-account of SLDF.  This new account is the S-353-C and titled the 
DOFAW  SLDF.  The funds from this account provide direct funding to private landowners 
to steward private lands - to manage, protect, and restore important watersheds and timber 
resources.   
 Land and Natural Resources Natural and Physical Environment (S-308-C) 
The Department will re
from a special fund to a trust account.  The DLNR will work with the Legislature to change 
the means of financing (MOF) for all related expenditures.   
Although it seems like it is a trust account, the account continues to serve the purpose for 
which it was originally established.  Additionally, the account is receiving revenues from     Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    69Honorable Leslie H. Kondo, State Auditor

However, it should be noted that the same account was reviewed during the prior review 
and there was no mention of it not being classified incorrectly.  The account has been used 
as a clearing account for certain holders of revocable permits for use of State waters on 
Maui, including the East Maui Irrigation Co. and Alexander & Baldwin, to obtain and pay 
for stream gauging services provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  
The Department then make payments for water monitoring and/or stream gauging services 
under a joint funding agreement with the USGS.  Expenditures include all costs associated 
with services provided by the USGS.  Because the USGC cannot enter into agreements 
with private parties, it bills the State, which in turn charges private parties for the same 
services.

 HRS 37-47 (Non-General):  The Department acknowledges the finding and/or observation 
that we missed filing two (2) accounts and will take the appropriate measures to ensure 
compliance.  Specifically, we will develop a ch ecklist to ensure that the annual non-general 
fund report submissions are complete.   
 HRS 37-48 (Non-General Program Measures):  The Department disagrees with this finding 
and/or observation and would like to note that report was not made for most Trust 
Funds/Accounts because of how the funds are used in these accounts.  For example, 
Accounts like T-901and T-902 and other similar accounts are meant for one specific 
reason.  The money being deposited into these accounts come from ceded lands, the ATTACHMENT 1ATTACHMENT 170    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024Honorable Leslie H. Kondo, State Auditor

funds are then transferred to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) per Act 271, SLH 1980.  
Other accounts are holding accounts (i.e., security deposit account, settlement account, 
etc.) for various receipts and expenditures.  The funds in these accounts cannot be 
measured for effectiveness and there are no program size indicators for them which is the 
information being required by the report.
HRS 37-49 (Non-General Cost Element):  The Department disagrees with this finding 
and/or observation.  This is the cost element report.  Written instructions to this report says, 
budgeted non-general 
set up to expend the funds in these accounts, and therefore, no budget details by cost 
elements.
HRS 37-52.5 (Admin Created):  The Department concurs w
observation that two (2) accounts were not submitted within thirty (30) working days of 
establishment.  The Conservation and Resources Enforcement Revolving Account (S-344-
C), established in 1988, and the Native Resources and fire Protection Program Trust Fund 
(T-920-C), established in 2012, were established years ago and the Department does not 
think it is still necessary to file this report.  The accounts have always been included in the 
annual submission of all Non-General Fund Reports.
Additionally, the Department would like to note that Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave Trust 
Fund (T-930-C) was not filed per the provisions of HRS 37-52.5 (Admin Created) because 
this account was notan administratively created account but was statutorily created per 
Act 119, SLH 2015, Item A-23.
DLNR appreciates the work put forward by the A
opportunity to provide a response.  The Department also appreciates the extension of time 
provided to submit our response.  Please contact me at (808) 587-0401 if you have any 
questions, or your staff may contact Cynthia C. Gomez at (808) 587-0340 or via email at

programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the Governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.

Chapter 1
Introduction
This review encompasses the special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, 
and trust accounts administered by the State of Hawai‘i Department of 
Land and Natural Resources (DLNR).  Section 23-12, Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes (HRS), requires the Auditor to review each state department’s 
special, revolving, and trust funds every five years.  Although not 
mandated by Section 23-12, HRS, we have included trust accounts as 
part of our review.  Trust accounts, like special, revolving, and trust 
funds, are funded outside of the General Fund appropriation process and 
are therefore generally subject to less legislative scrutiny than the State’ s 
General Fund.  For each fund and account, our review included: 
1. An evaluation of the original intent and purpose of the fund or 
account, both as expressed by the Legislature and as understood 
by the expending agency;  
2. The degree to which the fund or account achieves its stated and 
claimed purposes;
3. An evaluation of the fund or account’s performance standards as 
established by the agency; and 
4. A summary statement reflecting total fund transactions in 
the preceding five fiscal years, including the fund or account 
balance at the beginning of each fiscal year, total deposits and 
withdrawals, amount of interest earned, total expenditures made 
from the fund or account, and the ending balance for each fiscal 
year.
This is our seventh review of DLNR’s revolving funds, trust funds, and 
trust accounts.1  It is our third review of DLNR’s special funds since 
Act 130, Session Laws of Hawai‘i (SLH) 2013, amended Section 23-12, 
HRS, to require review of special funds along with revolving funds and 
trust funds.  We last examined these funds and accounts in 2018. 
1 Prior to 2013, Section 23-12, HRS, did not require reviews of departm ents’ special funds.2    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 1:  IntroductionSection 37-62, HRS, defines a special fund as one that is “dedicated 
or set aside by law for a specified object or purpose, but excluding 
revolving funds and trust funds.”  According to the State’s  Accounting 
Manual , special funds are funds used to account for revenues earmarked 
for particular purposes and from which expenditures are made for those 
purposes.
Section 37-62, HRS, defines a revolving fund as one “from which is 
paid the cost of goods and services rendered or furnished to or by a state 
agency and which is replenished through charges made for the goods or 
services or through transfers from other accounts or funds.”  Activities 
commonly financed through revolving funds include loan programs, 
which are initially established by general fund seed moneys and are then 
replenished through the repayment of loans.
Section 37-62, HRS, defines a trust fund as one in which “designated 
persons or classes of persons have a vested beneficial interest or 
equitable ownership, or which was created or established by a gift, 
grant, contribution, devise or bequest that limits the use of the fund 
to designated objects or purposes.”   Trust funds invoke a fiduciary 
responsibility of state government to care for and use the assets held 
only for those designated to benefit from the funds.  A pension fund is 
an example of a trust fund.  Contributions and payments are to be held 
for the beneficiaries of the pension fund.  Another example is tenants’ 
security deposits, which are held in trust for the future benefit of tenants 
and landlords.  Until forfeited or returned, deposits are the property of 
the tenants and should be accounted for accordingly.
The Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) defines a 
trust account as a separate holding or clearing account for state agencies.  
Trust accounts also serve as accounting devices to credit or charge 
agencies or projects for payroll or other costs. Description of

In 2002, the Legislature set the requirements for establishing and 
continuing special and revolving funds.  Sections 37-52.3 and 37-52.4, 
HRS, state that special and revolving funds may only be established by 
statute.   The criteria used to review special and revolving funds are the 
extent to which each fund:
• Serves a need, as demonstrated by: (a) the purpose of the 
program to be supported by the fund; (b) the scope of the 
program, including financial information on fees to be charged, 
sources of projected revenue, and costs; and (c) an explanation of 
why the program cannot be implemented successfully under the 
General Fund appropriation process;
• Reflects a clear nexus between the benefits sought and charges 
made upon the program users or beneficiaries, or a clear link 
between the program and the sources of revenue – as opposed 
to serving primarily as a means to provide the program or users 
with an automatic means of support removed from the normal 
budget and appropriation process;
• Provides an appropriate means of financing for the program 
or activity that is used only when essential to the successful 
operation of the program or activity; and
• Demonstrates the capacity to be financially self-sustaining.  Criteria for

Funds, and Trust 
Accounts
Special and revolving
fund criteria4    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 1:  IntroductionUnlike the requirements for special and revolving funds, the law is silent 
on whether a trust fund or trust account must be established by statute.  
The criteria used in this report to review trust funds and trust accounts 
are the extent to which the fund or account:
• Continues to serve the purpose and intent for which it was 
originally created, and 
• Meets the definition of a trust fund or trust account, respectively .
 
The first criterion is derived from the objectives of Section 23-12, HRS, 
which requires the Auditor to evaluate the original intent of each fund 
and account and the degree to which each fund and account achieves its 
stated purpose.  The second criterion assesses whether a fund is held by 
the State only for the benefit of those with a vested interest in the assets 
or an account is held as a separate or clearing account.
1. Identify and review all special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, 
and trust accounts of DLNR.
2. For each special fund, revolving fund, trust fund, and trust account, 
determine whether the fund or account meets the respective criteria. 
3. Provide a five-year (FY2019 – FY2023) unaudited financial 
summary for each fund and account of DLNR.
We reviewed all special funds, revolving funds, trust funds, and trust 
accounts administered by DLNR during the five-year period under 
review (FY2019 – FY2023).  Funds and accounts included those 
established by statute as well as by administrative authority.
To identify funds subject to this review, we used a variety of sources, 
including our prior reviews, accounting reports from DAGS, non-general 
fund reports, legislative budget briefing documents, and other records.  
To gain an understanding of fund operations, we reviewed applicable 
agency administrative rules and interviewed key fiscal and program 
personnel, as necessary. 
We obtained a summary statement for each fund that reflects total 
fund transactions in the preceding five fiscal years (July 1, 2018 to 
June 30, 2023), including beginning fund balances, total revenues, 
amount of interest earned, total expenditures, transfers, and ending 
fund balances for each fiscal year.   We requested explanations for Scope and

discrepancies between ending balances for FY2018 reported in our last 
review and opening balances reported for FY2019.  We did not audit the 
department’s financial data, which we provide for informational purposes 
only. 
Procedures were performed on each fund using relevant criteria as stated 
above.  We reviewed fund information for consistency with the intent 
of each fund’s use and to ascertain the relationship between charges 
on users and expenditures.  We reviewed information on performance 
standards established for the funds or accounts and performed other 
procedures as necessary. 
Where appropriate, we relied on our prior reports, including Report  
No. 18-19,  Review of Special Funds, Revolving Funds, Trust Funds, and 
Trust Accounts of the Department of Land and Natural Resources . 
Our review was conducted from August 2023 to April 2024.  
Recommendations were made where applicable.6    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 1:  Introduction    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    7This chapter presents the results of our review of nineteen special funds, 
two revolving funds, nine trust funds, and seven trust accounts.  Total 
fund fiscal year-end balances for DLNR were at least $132 million per

administratively established in FY2016 for a one-time transfer of funds for 
payroll costs.  In Report No. 18-19, we reported the fund as a sub-account of 
the Commercial Fisheries Special Fund.  Pursuant to Act 87 (SLH 2021), the 
remaining balance in the Ecosystem Protection and Restoration special fund 
was transferred to the General Fund; however, an immaterial balance remained 
in the fund for interest received after the transfer.  The department discontinued 
use of the Ecosystem Protection and Restoration special fund, but it continued 
to receive interest revenue.  We recommend that the department transfer 
the remaining balance of $31 for the original Ecosystem Protection and 
Restoration special fund to the General Fund.
Pursuant to Act 46 (SLH 2021), the Ocean Stewardship Special Fund was 
established, and the department used the Ecosystem Protection and Restoration 
special fund for purposes of the Ocean Stewardship Special Fund.  The financial 
data for the review period related to the original Ecosystem Protection and 
Restoration special fund has been consolidated with the Commercial Fisheries 
Special Fund consistent with prior years.  The financial data presented above

Fund Summary
Account Type Special fund
How was the fund created? Act 351 (SLH 1987)
Why was it created?The fund was originally created to be used for the identification, establishment, 
and management of natural area reserves; the acquisition of private lands for new 
natural area reserves; the operation of the Heritage Program; and the provision of 
matching funds for the Natural Area Partnership Program.  However, the programs 
are now primarily supported by the General Fund appropriation process and 
the fund is meant to primarily collect parking fees at ‘Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural Area 
Reserve to supplement visitor management.
Fund meets criteria?This fund does not meet the criteria of a special fund because it no longer serves 
the purpose for which it was originally established and the programs that the fund 
was created to support are now funded through the General Fund appropriation 
process.  Therefore, the fund should be repealed .
Performance standards No, the fund does not have performance standards.
RevenuesThe original source of revenue was 25 percent of the State’s conveyance tax 
pursuant to Act 195 (SLH 1993).  However, Act 84 (SLH 2015) eliminated the 
conveyance tax as the fund’s primary source of revenue and general funds were 
appropriated to support the program.  DLNR stated current revenues consist of 
parking fees collected at the Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural Area Reserve and interest.  We 
note no parking fees were collected during the period under review .
ExpendituresExpenditures include costs to support visitor management at ‘Āhihi-Kīna‘u Natural 
Area Reserve.  However, FY2019 and FY2021 expenditures include transfers 
to the General Fund pursuant to Act 12 (SLH 2018) and Act 87 (SLH 2021), 
respectively.

Section 183D-10.5, HRS    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    61Special, revolving, and other types of non-general funds are not subject 
to the same level of legislative scrutiny as the General Fund.  Accurate 
and complete reporting of all funds, as required by law, would greatly 
improve the Legislature’s oversight and control of these funds and 
provide increased budgetary flexibility.  Fund reports are one of the 
primary means through which the Legislature tracks non-general funds.  
The reports are used to monitor fund balances and identify excess 
moneys for possible transfer to the General Fund.
Non-General Funds Were Not Reported as Required by Law
Section 37-47, HRS, requires departments to submit to the Legislature an 
annual report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as the intended purpose of the fund, current program activities 
supported by the fund, and financial data.  The Director of Finance 
annually issues a memorandum requesting all departments complete and 
submit Form 37-47, Report on Non-General Fund Information , to the 
Department of Land and Natural Resources for each of their non-general 
funds.  The Department of Land and Natural Resources compiles a report 
of all non-general fund accounts and submits it to the Legislature prior to 
the start of each legislative session.
Section 37-48, HRS, enacted by the Legislature through Act 87 in 2021, 
requires departments to submit to the Legislature an annual program 
measures report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as program objectives, program activities, metrics for target 
population, and metrics for assessing effectiveness over the ensuing six 
fiscal years.  The report must be filed no later than October 1 annually.
Section 37-49, HRS, also enacted by the Legislature through Act 87 in 
2021, requires departments to submit to the Legislature an annual cost 
element report of each non-general fund account, including information 
such as budget details by cost element and non-general fund names and 
account codes for each item or object code.  The report must be filed no 
later than October 1 annually.
Section 37-52.5, HRS, requires the Judiciary and any department that 
administratively establishes a new fund or account to submit a report 
to the Legislature.  The report must be filed within 30  working days of 
a fund or account’s creation and should include a justification for the Chapter 3
Observations on Reporting and Accounting  
for Funds62    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024
Chapter 3:  Observations on Reporting and Accounting for Fundsfund or account and identification of its sources of revenue.  In addition, 
prior to the start of each legislative session, the law also requires each 
department to submit to the Legislature a listing of all administratively 
established funds or accounts along with a statement of their revenues, 
expenditures, encumbrances, and ending balances for each fund or 
account.  This report is separate from the non-general fund report 
required under Section 37-47, HRS.
During our review, we noted noncompliance with statutory  
requirements to report financial activity and balances, as required by 
Section 37-47, HRS, program measures, as required by Section 37-48, 
HRS, cost elements, as required by Section 37-49, HRS, as well as fund 
information for administratively established funds and accounts under 
Section 37-52.5, HRS.
As shown in Exhibit 3.1, DLNR had administratively created non-
general funds with balances totaling approximately $372,000 that were 
not reported to the Legislature as required by Section 37-52.5, HRS; 
non-general funds with balances totaling approximately $6.1 million that 
were not reported to the Legislature as required by Section 37-47, HRS; 
non-general funds with balances totaling $57.7 million that were not 
reported to the Legislature as required by Section 37-48, HRS; and  
non-general funds with balances totaling $52.8 million that were not 
reported to the Legislature as required by Section 37-49, HRS.    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    63Fund NameFund

the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources’ Comments
WE TRANSMITTED  a draft of this review to the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (DLNR) on August 19, 2024.  We received DLNR’s 
formal response to the draft report, which is attached in its entirety 
as Attachment 1, on September 3, 2024.  DLNR concurred with our 
recommendations for reclassifications and/or closure for two trust funds 
and two trust accounts and will consider our recommendations for two 
special funds after further review.
We reported that a special fund, Forest Stewardship Fund, did not meet 
the criteria of a special fund.  DLNR stated that the fund is necessary 
to be used to separate revenues from the harvest of non-native forest 
products from the forest reserves.  The fund was statutorily established 
pursuant to Section 195F-4(a)(1), HRS, which states that payments from 
the fund, “shall be made by the board pursuant to agreements entered 
into with qualified landowners to further the purposes of this chapter .”  
During our review, we noted that while the funds are being used for other 
purposes as laid out in Section 195F-4, HRS, the fund is not being used 
to make payments to landowners as intended.  Therefore, we maintain 
that this fund does not meet the special fund criteria as it is no longer 
used for the purpose for which it was established.
We reported that a trust account, Land Division – Water Monitoring 
Services, did not meet the criteria of a trust account.  The Department 
of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) defines a trust account as 
a separate holding or clearing account for state agencies.  While DLNR 
agreed to reclassify the trust account as a trust fund as we recommended, 
they stated that the account has been used as a clearing account for 
certain holders of revocable permits for use of State waters and for 
stream gauging services provided by the United States Geological Survey 
(USGS).  As DLNR is making payments to USGS on behalf of revocable 
permit holders, both of whom are not state agencies, we maintain 
that this trust account functions more like a trust fund and should be 
reclassified as such.
DLNR acknowledged our findings that two funds were not reported 
pursuant to Section 37-47, HRS, and will take appropriate measures to 
ensure compliance.Response to 
Agency CommentsOffice of the Auditor’s Response to the Department of Land and Natural Resources’ Comments
66    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024DLNR disagreed with our findings noting that most trust funds and trust 
accounts were not reported pursuant to Section 37-48, HRS, based on 
how the funds are used in these accounts.  DLNR stated that funds in 
these accounts cannot be measured for effectiveness and there are no 
program size indicators.  Section 37-48, HRS, requires departments to 
submit to the Legislature an annual program measures report of each 
non-general fund account.  Section 37-48, HRS, does not include any 
exceptions to the reporting requirement based on fund type.
DLNR also disagreed with our findings regarding reporting requirements 
pursuant to Section 37-49, HRS, as all non-reported funds are 
unbudgeted, and therefore, there are no budget details by cost elements.  
Section 37-49, HRS, requires departments to submit to the Legislature 
an annual cost element report of each non-general fund account.  
Section 37-49, HRS, does not include any exceptions to the reporting 
requirement based on budget status of funds or accounts.
DLNR concurred with our findings regarding two funds that were  
not reported pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.  However, DLNR stated 
that both funds were established years ago, and it did not think it was still 
necessary to file this report.  DLNR noted that the funds were included in 
the annual submission of Non-General Fund Reports.  Section 37-52.5, 
HRS, requires the Judiciary and any department that administratively 
establishes a new fund or account to submit a report to the Legislature.  
In addition, it requires each department to submit to the Legislature a 
listing of all administratively established funds or accounts along with 
a statement of their revenues, expenditures, encumbrances, and ending 
balances for each fund or account prior to the start of each legislative 
session.  This report is separate from the non-general fund report 
required under Section 37-47, HRS.  Therefore, we maintain that the 
funds identified in Exhibit 3.1 of our report were required to be reported 
pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.
DLNR also noted that the Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave Trust Fund 
was not filed pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS, because it was not 
administratively created and believes it was statutorily created per  
Act 119 (SLH 2015), Item A-23.  Act 119 (SLH 2015) is the budget 
bill for the state and Item A-23 establishes an appropriation but did 
not establish the fund.  In our prior reviews, we have reported it as 
administratively established.  Act 10 (SLH 2015) reclassified the fund 
from a revolving fund to a trust fund and stated, “The legislature finds 
that while the administratively established fund meets the purpose for 
which it was established, it does not meet the criteria for a revolving 
fund and that reclassifying it as a trust fund would be more appropriate.”  
Therefore, we maintain that the fund was administratively established 
and was required to be reported pursuant to Section 37-52.5, HRS.    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    67DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Dear Mr. Kondo:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your report entitled Review of Special Funds, 
Revolving Funds, Trust Funds, and Trust Accounts of the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources .  We have reviewed the draft report and offer the following comments:
Fund(s) Not Meeting Criteria

interest received from the State Investment Pool Account and will be transferred to the 
State treasury.

Conservation and Resources Enforcement Special Fund (S-302-C)
The DLNR has requested a ceiling increase during the last legislative session to use the 
funds to help with the recovery efforts related to the Maui wildfire disaster that began on 
August 8, 2023.  The Department is in the process of requesting for an expenditure ceiling 
by way of the Major Disaster Funds (MDF).ATTACHMENT 1ATTACHMENT 1

fund.  Although it should be noted that at the last review, the account was classified as a 
trust account and the Department was not informed that the classification was not correct. 
 Forest Stewardship Fund (S-347-C) 
During the 2015 legislative session, a portion of the conveyance taxes deposited to this 
account was repealed by the Legislature.  The conveyance tax distribution was replaced 
by general funds and special fund sources.  The special funds are coming from this account 
and from the Special Land and Development Fund (SLDF), per Sequence No. 3003-001, 
of Act 119, SLH 2015. 
This account gets its revenue from forest product sales, and fines or penalties for violations 
related to respecting boundaries and following laws of land stewardship are reinvested to 
sustain these types of activities and the broader management of the forest reserves.  The 
forest stewardship fund is essential to financially sustain certain activities within the Forest 
Reserve System.  All costs paid from the fund are for support of the management of the 
Forest Reserved System and the forest stewardship program.   
This account is necessary to separate revenues directly received from the harvest of non-
native forest products from forest reserves, from the harvest of native forest products from 
degraded forests as defined in Section 186-5.5, HRS, within forest reserves, from forest 
products found dead and lying on the ground, from the sale of tree seedlings from the State 
nurseries, the sale of any other products or services, or anything of value derived from 
forest reserves, or the imposition of fines or penalties from violations per Sections 195F, 
183, and 185, HRS. 
An account was also established to separate the funding from SLDF.  This is to show that 
this account is a sub-account of SLDF.  This new account is the S-353-C and titled the 
DOFAW  SLDF.  The funds from this account provide direct funding to private landowners 
to steward private lands - to manage, protect, and restore important watersheds and timber 
resources.   
 Land and Natural Resources Natural and Physical Environment (S-308-C) 
The Department will re
from a special fund to a trust account.  The DLNR will work with the Legislature to change 
the means of financing (MOF) for all related expenditures.   
Although it seems like it is a trust account, the account continues to serve the purpose for 
which it was originally established.  Additionally, the account is receiving revenues from     Report No. 24-08 / September 2024    69Honorable Leslie H. Kondo, State Auditor

However, it should be noted that the same account was reviewed during the prior review 
and there was no mention of it not being classified incorrectly.  The account has been used 
as a clearing account for certain holders of revocable permits for use of State waters on 
Maui, including the East Maui Irrigation Co. and Alexander & Baldwin, to obtain and pay 
for stream gauging services provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  
The Department then make payments for water monitoring and/or stream gauging services 
under a joint funding agreement with the USGS.  Expenditures include all costs associated 
with services provided by the USGS.  Because the USGC cannot enter into agreements 
with private parties, it bills the State, which in turn charges private parties for the same 
services.

 HRS 37-47 (Non-General):  The Department acknowledges the finding and/or observation 
that we missed filing two (2) accounts and will take the appropriate measures to ensure 
compliance.  Specifically, we will develop a ch ecklist to ensure that the annual non-general 
fund report submissions are complete.   
 HRS 37-48 (Non-General Program Measures):  The Department disagrees with this finding 
and/or observation and would like to note that report was not made for most Trust 
Funds/Accounts because of how the funds are used in these accounts.  For example, 
Accounts like T-901and T-902 and other similar accounts are meant for one specific 
reason.  The money being deposited into these accounts come from ceded lands, the ATTACHMENT 1ATTACHMENT 170    Report No. 24-08 / September 2024Honorable Leslie H. Kondo, State Auditor

funds are then transferred to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) per Act 271, SLH 1980.  
Other accounts are holding accounts (i.e., security deposit account, settlement account, 
etc.) for various receipts and expenditures.  The funds in these accounts cannot be 
measured for effectiveness and there are no program size indicators for them which is the 
information being required by the report.
HRS 37-49 (Non-General Cost Element):  The Department disagrees with this finding 
and/or observation.  This is the cost element report.  Written instructions to this report says, 
budgeted non-general 
set up to expend the funds in these accounts, and therefore, no budget details by cost 
elements.
HRS 37-52.5 (Admin Created):  The Department concurs w
observation that two (2) accounts were not submitted within thirty (30) working days of 
establishment.  The Conservation and Resources Enforcement Revolving Account (S-344-
C), established in 1988, and the Native Resources and fire Protection Program Trust Fund 
(T-920-C), established in 2012, were established years ago and the Department does not 
think it is still necessary to file this report.  The accounts have always been included in the 
annual submission of all Non-General Fund Reports.
Additionally, the Department would like to note that Accrued Vacation and Sick Leave Trust 
Fund (T-930-C) was not filed per the provisions of HRS 37-52.5 (Admin Created) because 
this account was notan administratively created account but was statutorily created per 
Act 119, SLH 2015, Item A-23.
DLNR appreciates the work put forward by the A
opportunity to provide a response.  The Department also appreciates the extension of time 
provided to submit our response.  Please contact me at (808) 587-0401 if you have any 
questions, or your staff may contact Cynthia C. Gomez at (808) 587-0340 or via email at

Report No. 24-08 / September 2024Four special funds, two trust funds, and 
two trust accounts did not meet criteria
OUR REVIEW  of nineteen special funds, two revolving funds, nine 
trust funds, and seven trust accounts of the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (DLNR) found four special funds, two trust funds, 
and two trust accounts did not meet the criteria for special funds, 
trust funds, and trust accounts, respectively, and should be closed or 
reclassified.
Section 23-12, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS), requires the Auditor 
to review all existing special, revolving, and trust funds every five 
years.  Reviews are scheduled so that each department’s funds are 
reviewed once every five years.  Although not mandated by statute, 
we included trust accounts as part of our review.  This is our seventh 
review of DLNR’s revolving funds, trust funds, and trust accounts.   
It is our third review of the special funds held by DLNR since  
Act 130, Session Laws of Hawai’i 2013, amended Section 23-12, 
HRS, to require review of special funds along with revolving funds 
and trust funds.
We used criteria developed by the Legislature and by our office 
based on public finance and accounting literature.  For each fund, 
we present a five-year financial summary, the purpose of the fund, 
and conclusions about its use.  We did not audit the financial 
data, which is provided for informational purposes.  We do not 
present conclusions about the effectiveness of programs or their 
management, or whether the programs should be continued.
Reporting shortfall
WE NOTED THAT DLNR  did not file statutorily required reports 
for non-general funds totaling approximately $6.1 million, 
administratively created non-general funds totaling approximately 
$372,000, non-general funds with balances totaling approximately 
$57.7 million under the program measures reporting requirement, and 
non-general funds with balances totaling approximately $52.8 million 
under the cost element reporting requirement.  Accurate and complete Auditor’s Summary
Review of Special Funds, Revolving Funds,  
Trust Funds, and Trust Accounts of the  
Department of Land and Natural Resources
Report No. 24-08
FUND TYPES
SPECIAL FUNDS
are used to account for 
revenues earmarked for 
particular purposes and 
from which expenditures 
are made for those 
purposes.
REVOLVING FUNDS
such as loan funds, 
are often established 
with an appropriation of 
seed money from the 
general fund, and must 
demonstrate the capacity 
to be self-sustaining.
TRUST FUNDS
such as a pension fund, 
invoke the State’s fiduciary 
responsibility to care for 
and use the assets held to 
benefit those with a vested 
interest in the assets.
TRUST ACCOUNTS
are typically separate 
holding or clearing 
accounts and are often 
used as accounting 
devices for crediting or 
charging state agencies 
or projects for payroll and 
other costs.Report No. 24-08 / September 2024reporting will greatly improve the Legislature’s oversight and control of these 
funds.
Agency response
DLNR CONCURRED WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS for reclassification and/
or closure for two trust funds and two trust accounts and will consider our 
recommendations for two special funds after further review.  DLNR noted 
that one of the special funds that did not meet criteria is necessary to separate 
revenues from the harvest of non-native forest products from the forest 
reserves.  DLNR also noted that one of the trust accounts that did not meet 
criteria is a clearing account for certain holders of revocable permits for the 
use of State waters and stream gauging services provided by the United States 
Geological Survey, both non-state agencies.  We maintain our assessment 
that these funds do not meet criteria for those types of funds established by 
the Legislature.  The special fund is not being used for the purpose for which 
it was established, and the trust account functions more like a trust fund.  
DLNR stated that it will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance 
with all statutory reporting requirements but they disagreed with our findings 
related to reporting requirements pursuant to Sections 37-48 and 37-49, HRS.   
We maintain our assessment that these funds and accounts should have 
been reported pursuant to Sections 37-48 and 37-49, HRS, as there are no 
exceptions to the reporting requirements based on fund type or budget status.

OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
STATE OF HAWAI‘I
A Report to the Governor 
and Legislature of the  
State of Hawai‘iPHOTO: ISTOCK.COM
OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
STATE OF HAWAI‘I
Constitutional Mandate
Pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the Hawai‘i State Constitution, the
Office of the Auditor shall conduct post-audits of the transactions, accounts, 
programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.

Section 23-71, HRS, requires the Auditor to review a variety of tax 
incentives identified in later sections of the chapter and outlines what, 
substantively, the Auditor is to analyze.  Section 23-76, HRS, identifies 
the specific exemptions and exclusions to be reviewed in 2023.  We 
review other tax incentives in other reports, and a list of which 
incentives will be reviewed in which year may be found in Appendix A.   
The exemptions and exclusions discussed in this report are to be 
revisited pursuant to a 10-year review cycle under Section 23-76, HRS.
Background
Hawai‘i’s GET applies to nearly all business activities in Hawai‘i.  In 
FY2022, which ended June 30, 2022, GET and Use Tax revenues 
summed to $4 billion, or nearly 38 percent of the total tax revenue from 
all sources.   
Lawmakers sometimes exclude or exempt certain revenues from 
taxation to promote social or economic goals, or for tax efficiency or 
equity.  Section 1 of Act 261, Session Laws of Hawai‘i (SLH) 2016, 
which established the annual review of GET, Use Tax, Public Service 
Company Tax, and Insurance Premium Tax exemptions, exclusions, and 
credits, noted that such provisions reduce revenue to the State.  That 
results in a need for all taxpayers, including those who do not directly 
benefit from such tax breaks, to compensate for the reduced revenue, or 
alternatively, the government must reduce spending on state programs.  
Despite the loss of revenue, the Legislature has stated that certain tax 
exemptions, exclusions, and credits are worthy of continuation for 
equity, efficiency, and economic and social policy purposes.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    3
Accordingly, the Legislature found the Auditor’s periodic reviews 
“necessary to promote tax equity and efficiency, adequacy of 
state revenues, public transparency, and confidence in a fair state 
government.”  Unfortunately, for most of the provisions now under 
review, neither the law nor the relevant legal history includes specific 
outcomes that the Legislature sought to achieve.  The Legislature has 
not articulated the purpose of each provision nor has it identified criteria 
against which to measure each provision.  Our mandate under which we 
conduct these reviews instructs us to determine the extent to which each 
provision achieves its purpose – a task made difficult when provisions 
fail to specify a purpose or a means by which to measure whether the 
purpose has been achieved.
We recommend the Legislature clearly articulate the purpose of each 
tax provision and establish specific metrics to measure the provision’ s 
effectiveness, which will permit a more thorough and meaningful 
analysis when we review these provisions in the future.  We further 
recommend that the Enterprise Zone exemptions be split from one 
section into two sections of the HRS, or otherwise separated, to 
delineate clearly between the two exemptions and reduce confusion 
regarding calculations related to their associated tax expenditures – as 
discussed in the Enterprise Zone exemption portion later in this report.
Hawai‘i’s General Excise Tax and Use Tax
Hawai‘i’s GET and Use Tax, together, ensure that the State of Hawai‘i 
will reap at least some benefit, in the form of tax revenue, from business 
operations in the State.  This is accomplished primarily by GET, a tax on 
the privilege of doing business in Hawai‘i and the largest source of tax 
revenue in the State.  For the privilege of doing business in the State of 
Hawai‘i, a business must pay GET – a tax separate from, and in addition 
to, income tax.  Unlike income tax, GET is a flat tax, meaning the rate 
of tax does not change with income level.  It is also a tax on product 
values, gross sales proceeds, and gross income receipts, meaning the tax 
ignores business expenses.  It applies to nearly every product or service 
sold in Hawai‘i.  GET does not apply, however, to out-of-state sellers.  
That is where the Use Tax applies. 
Use Tax complements GET by taxing goods and services imported for 
use in Hawai‘i and sold by sellers not already subject to GET.  It “levels 
the playing field” between buying from those subject to GET and those 
not subject to GET – often meaning local and out-of-state businesses, 
respectively.  One nuanced distinction between GET and Use Tax is that 
GET is usually assessed against gross proceeds or gross income, while 
Use Tax is assessed on the purchase price or value of the good or service 4    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesused.  Another distinction is that sellers typically pay GET, whereas 
purchasers or importers, depending on how the import is used, pay  
Use Tax. 
Reporting for GET and Use Tax is accomplished via the filing of a 
return: the “General Excise/Use Tax Return.”  There are two types of 
General Excise/Use Tax Returns: periodic and annual. 
The G-45 (Periodic Return):
Throughout the tax year, an individual or business subject to 
GET or Use Tax must file periodic GET/Use Tax returns, each 
of which is known as a Form G-45.  Periodic returns may be due 
semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly, depending on how much the 
taxpayer estimates it will owe in GET, over the course of the year.  
The higher a taxpayer’s gross income, the more the taxpayer will 
likely owe and the more frequently it should have to file.  Large 
enterprises with high revenues typically file monthly, while small 
enterprises are likely to file semi-annually.
Electronic filing of the G-45 is mandatory for all filers owing 
more than $4,000 in GET for a given year.  That means all 
monthly filers, including high-revenue businesses and import-
heavy businesses must file electronically.  As of April 9, 2024, we 
have found no law or guidance specifically requiring electronic 
filing for filers owing $4,000 or less, though the Department of 
Taxation (DOTAX) has announced that it may phase in more 
electronic filing mandates in the future.  Electronic filing of a 
G-45 is accomplished via the Hawai‘i Tax Online system.
The G-49 (Annual Return):
At the end of the tax year, all individuals or businesses subject to 
either GET or Use Tax file the annual GET/Use Tax return and 
reconciliation, or Form G-49.  The annual return should equal 
the sum of all the periodic returns, meaning the G-49 and the 
aggregate of the year’s G-45s should “reconcile” against each 
other.
Electronic filing is mandated for all G-49 filers.  Electronic filing 
of a G-49 is accomplished via DOTAX’s Hawai‘i Tax Online 
system.  Hawai‘i Tax Online is a resource that allows taxpayers to 
manage their tax accounts online.
There are ancillary GET and Use Tax forms, beyond the G-45 and 
G-49, that must be filed under certain circumstances.  An important 
one, for purposes of this review, is Schedule GE on which taxpayers 
claim exemptions and deductions.  It accompanies a G-45 or G-49 as 
a schedule attached to the return, and failing to include it will result     Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    5
in disallowance of the exemption or deduction.  Other forms beyond 
Schedule GE, the G-45, and the G-49, unless specifically discussed 
elsewhere in this report, are beyond the scope of our current review.
It is the position of DOTAX that an exclusion applies to revenue that 
was never meant to be taxable.  As GET is a tax on the privilege of 
doing business, revenues that are not from business activities are 
typically excluded – either by default or under a specific exclusion 
enacted toward that end.  Real estate is a classic example: revenues from 
the sale of real estate might be subject to income tax (as capital gains) 
but are not subject to GET.  It is the business of selling or buying real 
estate, meaning the commissions earned from real estate sales, that is 
GET-taxable.1  Taxpayers generally do not report excluded amounts 
to DOTAX, such that DOTAX cannot capture related information.  
Consequently, DOTAX does not report data on exclusions.  
Rates at a Glance
While GET is a tax on business income, it resembles a consumption 
tax or sales tax in that the cost is typically passed along to consumers.    
However, GET is distinct from a typical sales tax in that it is a tax on 
businesses, whereas a sales tax is a tax on consumers  that is collected 
by a business.  GET is also distinct in that it is assessed on nearly 
every business transaction – wholesale and retail, goods and services – 
resulting in a broad tax base.  By contrast, a typical sales tax applies to 
retail sales of tangible goods only.  
Retailing includes the selling of tangible personal property for end 
consumption or use by the purchaser – as opposed to selling for resale 
purposes – as well as the renting of tangible personal property and the 
rendering of services by a service business.  For example, a farmer’s 
market vendor selling mangoes to passers-by to eat should be taxed 
at the retail rate.  Wholesaling includes a business’s selling goods or 
services to another business for resale.  Were that same market vendor to 
sell to a store owner who sold the mangoes to the store’s customers, the 
vendor should be taxed at the wholesale rate.
For tax year 2023, GET rates were as follows:  
• 0.15 percent on commissions from insurance sales;  
• 0.5 percent on revenue received by manufacturers and 
wholesalers, as defined by statute and as discussed later in this 
report; and  
1 See sidebar, “Tax Expenditures: At What ‘Cost’?” on page 13 for a detailed explana -
tion of tax expenditures.6    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes• 4.0 percent on revenue received from all other activities including, 
but not limited to, the retail sale of tangible personal property 
(goods) or services, construction contracting, renting or leasing 
real or personal property, business interest income, commissions 
(except insurance commissions), and theaters and amusements.  
For tax year 2023  Use Tax rates were as follows:
Wholesale-to-Wholesale
0.0 percent (no tax) on the use of goods or value of services 
imported by GET-licensed wholesalers and on other items for other 
importers subject to the wholesale GET rate;
Wholesale-to-Retail and Certain Others
0.5 percent on the use of goods or value of services imported by 
GET-licensed retailers, publishing, certain professional services, and 
the furnishing of transient accommodations; and
Retail-to-End Consumers and All Others
4.0 percent on the value transacted in all other cases of goods and 
services imports, and in all cases of intangible property imports.
As the rates above illustrate, manufacturers, wholesalers, and, in the 
case of Use Tax, resellers, benefit from lower rates.  Consequently, 
whether a taxpayer qualifies for any of the above rates is of critical 
importance to determining GET and Use Tax liability.
County Public Transportation Surcharges  
(Chapters 237, 238, and 248, HRS)    
Since 2007, the City and County of Honolulu has imposed a 0.5 percent 
GET and Use Tax surcharge to help fund its public transportation 
system.  Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i, and Maui counties have also each adopted 
0.5 percent surcharges.  There is no surcharge on revenues exempt from 
GET or Use Tax.  Hence, in addition to reducing overall state revenue, 
exemptions and exclusions reduce county revenue.       Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    7
HAWAI‘I’S GET,  like most sales taxes across the 
country, is a product of the Great Depression.  
While the Territory of Hawai‘i did not experience 
the level of unemployment and economic distress 
experienced by more industrialized areas of the 
United States, falling land values during the early 
1930s led to a drop in real and personal property 
tax revenue, which were then the mainstays of 
the Hawai‘i tax structure.  In response, the 1932 
Territorial Legislature cut real property tax rates and 
repealed the levy on personal property.  To make 
up for the lost revenue, the Legislature adopted 
a business excise tax, which taxed the operating 
costs of each entity doing business in Hawai‘i.  In 
1935, the Legislature replaced the business excise 
tax with GET, a tax on gross proceeds.   
Containing elements of both business and 
consumption taxation, GET was designed to 
redistribute the tax burden to different industries 
and their consumers.2  Estimates prepared for the 
1935 House Finance Committee predicted that 
the sugar, ranching, and diversified agriculture 
industries would receive tax relief while the 
retail industry would experience the greatest tax 
increase.  Although the adoption could be viewed 
as a concession to some of Hawai‘i’s oldest and 
largest businesses, this change in tax policy may 
have been prophetic, as the Islands’ economy 
underwent fundamental changes.   
Even by 1939, the retailing industry was accounting 
for the Territory’s largest “taxable value,” or “tax 
base,” at $123.72 million, or 33 percent of the 
Territory’s total $376.71 million tax base.  At  
$41.60 million, sugar comprised 11 percent of  
the tax base, with pineapple close behind at  
$35.44 million, or 9 percent of the tax base.  
Meanwhile, the tax base for service industry 
businesses was just $17 million, or 4.5 percent of 
the total.  By Statehood in 1959, while all industries 
rose with the favorable economic tides, the gap 
between business and consumption tax bases grew 
wider.  Retailing’s tax base ballooned to  
$707.53 million (35 percent of the total tax base), 
2 Hawai‘i’s General Excise Tax , Report No. 2, 1963, 
Legislative Reference Bureau, State of Hawai‘i, p. 8. while services saw even greater growth at  
$160.49 million (8 percent of the total).   
Meanwhile, sugar and pineapple had tax bases of 
$93.42 million and $98.43 million respectively, with 
each comprising about 5 percent of the tax base.  
Today, the retailing and service industries are still 
the breadwinners for the state when it comes to 
GET.  For FY2023, DOTAX reported that retailing 
had a tax base of $47.55 billion, or 33.9 percent of 
the total tax base, with services at $20.18 billion, or 
14.4 percent of the tax base.  How We Got GET
General Excise Tax in Hawai‘i 
In FY2022, the State General Fund, which is the 
State’s chief operating fund, realized a total of  
$10.46 billion in tax collections.  Most of that  
revenue came from two taxes: GET and income tax.  
Income tax collections, which are comprised  
of both individual and corporate income tax 
revenues, represent Hawai‘i’s largest tax revenue 
source and accounted for $4.02 billion.  GET, the 
fund’s second largest tax revenue source, accounted 
for $4.01 billion, or 38.3 percent of total general fund 
tax revenue.  The Transient Accommodations Tax, 
the State’s third-largest revenue source, accounted 
for $739 million, or 7.1 percent.    Source: DOTAX Annual Report for fiscal year

Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesAnalysis of Reviewed Tax Provisions
What did we review?
This report reviews a total of eight tax provisions encompassing nine 
exemptions from GET, pursuant to Section 23-76, HRS.  One provision, 
regarding State of Hawai‘i Enterprise Zones, includes two exemptions: 
one for qualified Enterprise Zone businesses and one for contractors 
engaged in construction in Enterprise Zones.  Though they are reported 
by taxpayers to DOTAX separately, we review the two Enterprise 
Zone exemptions together to follow closely our mandate and issue a 
recommendation on the singular provision to which both relate.
Our analysis included reviewing confidential DOTAX taxpayer 
records under authority provided by Section 231-3.3, HRS, which 
was adopted under Act 177, SLH 2017, to facilitate our reviews.  That 
section requires that any information accessed by the Auditor remain 
confidential, with limited exceptions.  
What did we find?
We determined that six exemptions appear to be achieving what we 
understand to be their originally intended purposes.  We could not 
determine whether the remaining three exemptions (including the two 
Enterprise Zone exemptions combined under Section 209E-11, HRS) 
were achieving their purposes, primarily because of a lack of data 
regarding utilization and economic impact.  The statute requiring us to 
conduct these reviews does not set forth benchmarks or metrics to assess 
whether the provisions reviewed are achieving their intended purposes, 
and, prior to 2017, DOTAX did not systematically track GET and Use 
Tax exemptions.  The following Table 1 summarizes our results.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    9

Assessment Challenges:
Few Metrics on Purpose Achievement  
and No Data on Economic Impact
A significant challenge we encountered was the lack of any metrics by 
which to quantify or otherwise assess whether an exemption is meeting 
its purpose and how it is affecting, if at all, the State economy.  Our 
mandate at Section 23-71, HRS, requires that, with respect to any 
reviewed exemption enacted because of its purported economic or 
employment benefit, the Auditor quantify the benefit and comment on 
whether the benefit outweighs the cost of the exemption.  Our mandate 
does not provide criteria or other direction for identifying or quantifying 
the intended benefit, and – for most exemptions – businesses are not 
required to provide information on jobs created or other economic 
impact information to the State.  Additionally, most provisions reviewed 
in this report, like those reviewed in prior reports, do not include 
purpose statements or other explicit indications as to what their intended 
benefits were or are.  Our mandate does specify, however, that the 
purpose of an incentive may be “reasonably identified by the auditor .”  
Where possible, we considered House and Senate committee reports 
and other sources of legislative history to identify purpose and intended 
benefits, to the extent the Legislature discussed such before or during * Note: There are two Enterprise Zones exemptions written into Section 209E-11, HRS.  Both were 
analyzed together, as they relate to the same tax provision that the Auditor is mandated to review. 10    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesenactment.  Ultimately, we were able to calculate expenditure values 
from DOTAX data, but not the extent to which many of the exemptions 
affected the economy.  In short, we could usually measure the cost, but 
not the benefit, of an exemption.
Lack of Forecasting Tools and Data
Lack of current data and forecasting tools also hindered our ability to 
predict future tax expenditures.  Our mandate requires not only a review 
of past incentive performance, but also an estimation of tax expenditure 
for the current and next two calendar years.  The latest DOTAX 
and Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 
(DBEDT) data is from 2022, and our office does not have economic 
modeling software or similar tools for predictive calculations.  We also 
note that, according to DBEDT, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly 
impacted at least one exemption in this report, such that any trend 
mapped using data from 2022 and earlier might be of dubious reliability 
for future value estimations.  Even absent the pandemic, proving 
causality between an exemption and a rise or decline in any particular 
economic activity is not feasible without identifying and eliminating 
other potential causes.  Regarding job creation, for example, there is no 
readily available data proving or disproving that a business claiming an 
exemption and creating jobs would have created those jobs irrespective 
of any exemption claim.  Likewise, there is no data readily available 
regarding the economic impact of businesses ineligible to claim a 
particular exemption, or eligible businesses that elect not to claim an 
exemption to which they are entitled.
Use of Statutory Formula for Low-Income Resident 
Calculations
An additional concern is that we conducted an analysis of the impact 
of the tax provisions on “low-income residents” using a formula 
provided in the statute.  We question whether the calculations represent 
the “value” that repeal of a particular tax provision would have for 
low-income residents.  Although money generated from repealing a 
particular exemption or exclusion likely will increase tax revenues, the 
impact of the additional funds will not confer a benefit upon low-income 
residents in particular, but to all residents.  Further discussion on “low-
income resident” calculations can be found in Appendix B.
Undefined Terms
An additional concern is that the term tax expenditure  is not defined 
in Hawai‘i’s laws, including in Section 23-71, HRS, which mandates 
this review.  The following sidebar explains how tax exemptions 
and exclusions generally work, but as noted in previous reports, the 
Auditor and DOTAX have different interpretations of how to calculate     Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    11
a tax expenditure.  This report considers a tax expenditure to be the 
amount of tax revenue forgone as a result of a tax provision.  See “Tax 
Expenditures: At What ‘Cost’?” on page 13.  
Exclusions and Exemptions
TAX BREAKS to promote tax equity, efficiency, or various economic and social goals may allow money 
that would otherwise be spent on taxes to remain in the hands of taxpayers.  For example, taxpayers 
who own or operate businesses may use those tax savings to create jobs.  Other preferences may 
provide economic support to specific segments of society.
EXEMPTIONS COME AT A COST.   Allowing certain taxpayers to reduce the amount of gross revenues 
that are subject to GET decreases the amount of tax revenues that might otherwise be available for 
the State to spend.  While direct spending programs are subject to review through the budgetary 
process, moneys the State does not see can be more challenging to evaluate.  Identifying whether 
the benefits of tax exemptions outweigh their costs can be a complex endeavor , but such reviews can 
provide important information to legislators about the effectiveness of a tax preference and moneys 
that may be available for other state priorities.According to DOTAX, exclusions are tax law 
provisions that remove from tax reporting, 
entirely, revenues from activities never intended 
to be taxed.  Income that is excluded is not 
reported on a tax return, as if the income never 
existed for tax purposes.  As unreported, it is 
effectively ignored in tax calculations and not 
subject to taxation.EXCLUSIONS
Exemptions refer to revenues from taxable 
activities or goods that, for policy purposes, are not 
subject to taxation.  Income that is exempt typically 
is reported on a tax return or other tax record, but 
is subtracted out of taxable income.  Thus, there 
should be a record of each exemption claimed.  
Tax exemptions usually, but not always, have 
associated tax expenditures.  EXEMPTIONS12    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWE ARE REQUIRED  to assess 
whether the tax provisions 
reviewed are necessary to promote 
or preserve tax equity or efficiency.  
The law, however, does not define 
these terms.  Rather, our analysis 
is based upon criteria developed 
by the U.S. Joint Committee on 
Taxation and the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office, as detailed 
in the Association of International 
Certified Professional Accountants

According to that framework, tax 
efficiency  is the principle that a tax

or reduce the productive capacity 
of the economy.  Tax equity  is the 
principle of taxing taxpayers fairly, 
which means, among other things, 
that similar taxpayers be taxed 
similarly while taxpayers with the 
greatest ability to pay have the 
highest tax burdens.  The concept 
of horizontal equity provides that 
two taxpayers with equal abilities 
to pay should pay the same 
amount of tax, while the concept 
of vertical equity provides that a 
person with the greater payment 
ability pay more.Under the concept of efficiency, 
a tax system should avoid 
hindering economic goals, such 
as economic growth, capital 
formation, and competitiveness 
with other jurisdictions.  A separate, 
but related, concept states that 
administrative and compliance 
costs should be kept low to foster 
effective tax administration.  
However, a tax provision meant 
to improve tax efficiency for one 
group of taxpayers can result in 
less equitable treatment of other 
taxpayers.  For example, an 
exemption designed to increase 
economic activity in a certain 
industry or geographic area will 
reduce tax equity by providing 
favorable tax treatment to these 
activities.  Therefore, lawmakers 
must carefully balance both 
principles to optimize tax policy. 
Section 23-71, HRS, requires 
the Auditor to determine not only 
whether reviewed tax provisions 
promote tax equity or efficiency, but 
also whether they are “necessary 
to promote or preserve tax equity or 
efficiency.”  That mandate implies 
a need to consider each provision 
within Hawai‘i’s current social, 
economic, and budgetary contexts.Tax Equity and Efficiency: Finding the Balance
The concept of  
horizontal equity  
provides that two  
taxpayers with equal  
abilities to pay should pay  
the same amount of tax.
In contrast, vertical equity  
provides that a person with  
the greater ability to pay  
should pay more tax.

IN 2022,  there were 935 claims for all exemptions 
reviewed in this report.  Taxpayers claimed 
$3,726,755,969 in exemptions that we reviewed, 
resulting in, according to our calculations, 
$100,917,175 in tax expenditure.  Overall, 29,080 
taxpayers representing 12.1 percent of the total 
number of GET and Use Tax filers claimed 33,290 
GET exemptions, totaling $32.6 billion, in 2022.
As DOTAX explains in its 2022 Hawai‘i General 
Excise and Use Tax Exemptions report, tax 
expenditures “are the implied revenue cost of the  
deviation from applying the excise and use tax on 
all consumers in Hawaii without any exemptions.”  
The report lists exemptions that DOTAX 
categorizes as tax expenditures at wholesale 
and retail rates (0.5 percent and 4.0 percent, 
respectively), and lists exemptions that DOTAX 
does not consider to be tax expenditures, but 
which may represent forgone opportunities to shift 
tax burdens to non-residents.  
There are also certain exemptions that DOTAX 
does not consider to be “tax expenditures” 
and for which it therefore does not include tax 
expenditure amounts in its report.  For example, 
there are GET exemptions for worker wages, 
stock and bond sales, bad debts, and fee simple 
land sales.  These items, DOTAX states, are 
not traditionally included in the base of a sales 
or excise tax.  They are not properly part of a 
broad-based tax on consumption and would not 
be subject to a sales or excise tax.  Thus, as per 
DOTAX, no actual tax is forgone, meaning there is 
no associated tax expenditure.
DOTAX acknowledges that the assumptions 
underlying its classification scheme may change.  The estimated tax expenditure stemming from 
exemptions varies significantly depending 
on the method used to calculate it.  DOTAX 
calculates tax expenditure of GET exemptions 
using the GET wholesale rate of 0.5 percent 
for all business-to-business claimants.  The 
implicit assumption is that, were the exemption 
nonexistent, all business-to-business taxpayers 
would pay GET on unexempted income at the 
wholesale rate only.  We question DOTAX’s 
assumption, as at least some claims for these 
exemptions were actually made at the retail 
rate, signaling that the taxpayers consider the 
underlying transactions retail, and not wholesale.  
Whether a taxpayer might recharacterize a 
transaction from retail to wholesale, depending 
on whether a taxpayer is paying tax or exempting 
income, is a matter of conjecture.  Our estimate 
is based on the value of the claims and the actual 
tax rate against which they were claimed and, for 
2022, comes to $100,917,175.  
Another concern is that, as DOTAX’s 2022 Hawai‘i 
General Excise and Use Tax Exemptions report 
notes, tax expenditures do not equate to the true 
amount of revenue realized if the exemption were 
to be repealed:  
The data presented in this report provide only 
the amounts of each exemption claimed and 
should not be relied on as an estimate of the 
amount of revenue that may be realized by 
repealing an exemption.  A revenue impact 
estimate must account for the potential 
substitutional and behavioral effects of 
repealing an exemption.Tax Expenditures: At What “Cost”?14    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Act 160, SLH 2013,  
reassigned the exemption  
from Section 237-24.3(5) to 
Section 237-24.3(4), HRS.What does this exemption do?
This exemption exempts from GET two sets of income related to 
employee benefit plans (Plans).  First, it exempts contributions, 
dividends, interest, and other income received by a Plan.  Second, 
it exempts income received by a nonprofit organization or office as 
payments for costs and expenses incurred for the administration of a 
Plan.  Not exempt are gross rental income and gross rental proceeds 
from investments in real property.  Real property investment income 
remains taxable, even if it signifies one of the two sets of income that 
the provision would otherwise exempt.
A Plan, for purposes of the exemption, includes both employee 
welfare benefit plans and employee pension benefit plans.  An 
employee welfare benefit plan is a plan, fund, or program established 
or maintained by an employer or employee organization for the 
purpose of providing to participants medical, unemployment, 
vacation, apprenticeship, day care, scholarship, and legal services 
benefits.  An employee pension benefit plan is a plan, fund, or 
program established or maintained by an employer or employee 
organization and that defers employee income or otherwise provides 
employee retirement income.
How the Exemption is Claimed
Claimants exempt qualified amounts by reporting the revenue on 
“Schedule GE (Form G-45/G-49),” the General Excise/Use Tax 
Schedule of Exemptions and Deductions (hereafter referred to as 
Schedule GE) submitted with a GET return.  The taxpayer includes 16    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statuteson Part I of Schedule GE all exemptions claimed, reporting the amount 
of each exemption and other information specific to the exemption, 
including an “ED Code,” or exemption/deduction code, that corresponds 
to the law allowing the exemption.  The ED Code for the Employee 
Benefit Plans exemption is 114. 
Neither Schedule GE nor any GET return requires claimants to provide 
proof of or otherwise substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  
However, because revenues associated with income related to employee 
benefit plans must be reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify 
tax expenditure. 
What is the purpose of this exemption?
Neither the 1985 original enactment nor any related committee report 
specifies any particular legislative purpose for exempting benefit plan 
income.  However, the Senate Committee on Labor and Employment 
referenced testimony from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners of America that general excise tax reduces moneys available 
to pay benefits to employees and retirees.  We infer, then, that one 
intended purpose of removing general excise tax is to increase moneys 
available to pay benefits to employees and retirees – noting that, per our 
mandate, the purpose of an incentive may be “reasonably identified by 
the auditor.”
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
How much the removal of general excise tax through this exemption 
in fact increases moneys available to pay benefits to employees and 
retirees is something we cannot determine.  Benefit plans, and not 
necessarily their employees and retirees, are the direct beneficiaries of 
the exemption.  While we know from claims made that benefit plans 
are saving tax dollars, there is no data readily available to indicate or 
prove whether those dollars are passed on to employees and retirees 
or diverted elsewhere.  In other words, we do not know – and cannot 
assume – what benefit plans are doing with their tax savings.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 59, 57, 37, and 33 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this provision 
was $395,321,000, $356,437,000, $501,247,000, and $332,397,000, 
respectively.
When determining the tax expenditure corresponding to this exemption, 
DOTAX appears to treat this incentive as an exclusion.  It assigns no – 
or $0 – tax expenditure to the exemption for every year.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    17
We disagree with the DOTAX treatment of the exemption and its 
corresponding calculation of the associated tax expenditure of $0.  
We believe the exemption does yield an expenditure because, prior 
to the existence of the exemption, the State did, in fact, tax relevant 
income.  The exemption signifies a forgoing of tax revenue and thus an 
expenditure. 
We calculated the amount of revenue that would have been collected 
but for the exemption, in the table below.  As all claims related to 
transactions taxable at the 4 percent rate, which is the rate indicated by 
those claiming the exemption, we multiplied the sum of all claims by 
4 percent to determine the revenue forgone, i.e., the tax expenditure 
associated with the exemption.

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is no readily available data correlating, in any way, claims to 
exempt benefit plan income and economic or employment benefits to 
Hawai‘i.  
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for benefit plan income be 
retained.  We see no reason to modify the exemption, and repeal would 
lead to the imposition of a tax known to reduce benefit plan moneys 
available to employees and retirees.  Retaining the exemption will 
ensure that it continue to meet its purpose of preventing the reduction of 
such moneys.

Legislative History
1985
Congress passed the Food 
Security Act of 1985, which 
prohibited states that impose 
a sales tax on food stamp 
purchases from participating 
in the federal food stamp 
program.  It was effective 
after the end of each state’s 
next legislative session, 
affording each state time to 
modify its laws, if needed.
1986
Act 86, SLH 1986, enacted 
the exemption for food 
stamp purchases, codified as 
Section 237-24(23), HRS, but 
with a proviso.  The proviso 
was that the exemption 
would apply only if the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture 
determined that the 
application of Hawai‘i’s GET 
to food stamp purchases 
would disqualify Hawai‘i from 
participating in the Food 
Stamp Program, under the 
Food Security Act of 1985.
Congress passed the School 
Lunch and Child Nutrition 
Amendments of 1986, 
prohibiting states that impose 
a sales tax on purchases 
made under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC)7 from 
participating in that program.
1987
Act 15, SLH 1987,  
removed the proviso from 
Section 237-24(23), HRS, exempting all federal food 
coupons unconditionally.  
Act 15 also expanded 
the exemption to exempt 
amounts received for 
purchases made with food 
vouchers under WIC.
Act 39, SLH 1987, 
reassigned the exemption 
from subsection (23) to 
subsection (22) of  
Section 237-24, HRS.
1993
Act 220, SLH 1993, 
reassigned the exemption 
from Section 237-24(22) to 
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS.
2013
Act 160, SLH 2013, 
reassigned the exemption 
from Section 237-24.3(6) to 
Section 237-24.3(5), HRS.

7 The Child Nutrition Amendments of 1986, as well as Act 15, SLH 1987, and  
Section 237-24.3(5), HRS, all use “Food” or “Foods” in place of “Nutrition” in the full 
program name for WIC.  However, the Hawai’i Department of Health uses “Nutrition” in 
the program name.  In this report, we use “Nutrition” in the program name to align with 
other current government publications and to reflect the fact that WIC covers not only food 
products, but also nutrition counseling, screening, and health services referrals.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    19
What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET all revenues from purchases using 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food coupons under the 
Food Stamp Program or with USDA food vouchers under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC).  It states that Chapter 237, HRS – which relates to GET – 
does not apply to purchases made with food stamps or with WIC 
vouchers.  
The Food Stamp Program, officially known as the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is a federal program that 
provides food and nutritional support to qualifying low-income and 
needy households.  It is funded through the USDA and administered 
at both the federal and state levels.  In Hawai‘i, the Department of 
Human Services (DHS) administers the program.
WIC is also a federally funded program that provides supplemental 
foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion, and health 
and social service referrals to qualifying low-income and pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or postpartum women, and persons under age five 
who are at medical or nutritional risk.  The USDA administers the 
program at the federal level, and the Hawai‘i Department of Health 
(DOH) administers it at the state level.
How the Exemption is Claimed
Businesses that receive food stamps and WIC food vouchers report 
the corresponding revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/
Deductions (ED) Code 119, “Food Stamps and WIC (§237-24.3(5)).”  
The revenues are thus reported and are subtracted from the 
businesses’ total revenues on the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49, 
resulting in no GET liability on those revenues.  We note that even 
though the exemption applies to separate federal food assistance 
programs – one for food stamps and one for WIC food vouchers –  
it evolved as, and continues to be reported as, a single exemption.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise 
substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because 
revenues associated with food stamps and WIC food vouchers must 
be reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What are the purposes of this exemption?
The Food Security Act of 1985 prohibits states participating in 
the Food Stamp Program from imposing sales tax on food stamp 
receipts.  Enacting the exemption allowed Hawai‘i to continue to 
participate in the program.20    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesThe School Lunch and Child Nutrition Amendments of 1986 prohibit 
states participating in the WIC program from imposing sales tax on 
WIC receipts.  Enacting the exemption allowed Hawai‘i to continue to 
participate in the program.
Is the exemption meeting its purposes?
Allowing continued participation in both the food stamp and WIC 
programs, the exemption is achieving its purposes as intended.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption in 2019-2021?
DOTAX reports 411, 392, 383, and 390 GET filings claiming the 
exemption in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of 
those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under 
this exemption was $366,558,000, $499,320,000, $830,302,000, and 
$1,016,107,000, respectively.
We and DOTAX agree that the tax expenditure for all four years should 
be zero, but we agree for different reasons.  DOTAX reasons that 
purchases made with food stamps and WIC vouchers would not be 
subject to a sales, excise, or other form of consumption tax, even absent 
an exemption, because the federal government does not permit such 
taxation of such items.  That is, the State would collect $0 even without 
the exemption, because it would not be allowed to tax the underlying 
items.  While we agree with the ultimate outcome, we note that the 
relevant federal law – the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended – does 
not directly prohibit taxation; instead, it prohibits participation in the 
food stamp program for any state that does tax food stamp purchases.  
If it so wished, Hawai‘i could, legally, impose GET law on revenue 
relating to food stamp and WIC program-related purchases.  However, 
taxing the receipts would mean non-participation in the programs, which 
would mean no more receipts, which would mean $0 tax.

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, do the benefits outweigh the costs of this exemption?
The primary benefit of this exemption is the continued ability of the 
State to participate in the Food Stamp Program and WIC.  It is in part 
because of the exemption that the State receives federal funds to feed 
and safeguard the health of low-income residents in need.  Given that 
the tax expenditure is $0, and assuming that the Legislature and State 
generally view welfare positively, the impact to Hawai‘i residents 
should be purely beneficial.
Should this exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for food stamp and WIC 
voucher purchases be retained without modification.  Maintaining the 
nontaxability of such purchases is necessary to continuing Hawai‘i 
participation in the Food Stamp and WIC programs.  As stated by the 
Senate Committee on Human Services, loss of participation would 
have a significant negative impact on the public health of the people of 
Hawai‘i.22    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET the revenue from certain  
sales of prescription drugs and prosthetic devices.  It states that  
Chapter 237, HRS – which relates to GET – does not apply to the 
qualified sales.  To qualify for the exemption, the sale must be by 
a hospital, infirmary, medical clinic, health care facility, pharmacy, 
or, in the case of a drug sale, a pharmacist or practitioner licensed to 
administer the drug.  The sale must also be to an individual.  Services 
sold in connection with the sale of any drug or prosthetic device do 
not qualify the exemption. 
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS, defines “prescription drugs” to include 
only those drugs whose introduction or delivery into interstate 
commerce has been approved by the U.S. Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, and sold by licensed pharmacists or practitioners 
licensed to administer them.  Statutorily excluded from prescription 
drugs covered by the exemption are cannabis and manufactured 
cannabis products.
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS, defines “prosthetic device” to include 
any artificial device used to replace a missing or removed part of 
the human body, so long as the device is prescribed by a licensed 
practitioner of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatry and sold by 
that practitioner or a dealer of such devices.  Also included are 
components of, and accessories to, such device.  Notably excluded, 
for exemption purposes, are all auditory, ophthalmic, dental, and 
ocular devices.General Excise Tax Exemption for Prescriptions and

We note that while the sales of the tangible drugs and devices 
themselves are exempt, this exemption does not apply to any services 
rendered in connection with such sales.  Income from such services 
remain subject to GET. 
How the Exemption is Claimed
A seller of prescription drugs and prosthetic devices reports 
corresponding revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions 
(ED) Code 113, “Drugs and Prosthetic Devices  (§237-24.3( 6)).”  
Although the revenues relating to the sale of prescription drugs are 
reported together with those from the sale of prosthetic devices, the 
combined revenues are subtracted from the business’s total revenues on 
the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49.  No GET should be owed on the 
relevant revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise substantiate 
the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because revenues 
associated with prescription drugs and prosthetic devices must be 
reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What are the purposes of this exemption?
The exemption for prescription drugs and prosthetic devices was 
part of a package of GET exemptions aimed at encouraging business 
expansion.  According to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, 
the exemptions would increase revenues to the State through business 
activity and lower the pyramiding tendences of GET, ultimately 
reducing costs to final purchasers.  With respect to prescription drugs 
and prosthetics, a more specific goal was to assist lower income and 
elderly populations.  The committee believed that the exemption would 
be of particular assistance to the chronically ill and alleviate the high 
cost of living in Hawai‘i. 
Is the exemption meeting its purposes?
Regarding the purpose of encouraging business expansion, there is 
insufficient readily available data to draw a causal link between the tax 
exemption and any related business expansion in the State.  
Regarding the purpose of reducing costs to final purchasers and 
alleviating the high cost of living in Hawai‘i, the exemption should 
be having an effect exactly equal to the amount of tax that, absent 
the exemption, would be passed on to consumers.  As detailed in the 
economic impact paragraphs below, prices for prescription drugs have 
risen more than twice as fast as household income, such that any tax 
savings should have also risen.  24    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this

The expenditures calculated by DOTAX appear to imply that DOTAX 
treats all claims for this exemption as related to retail transactions only. 
The rate applicable to retail transactions is 4 percent, and the DOTAX 
expenditure values (apart from rounding to the nearest $1,000) are 
exactly 4 percent of corresponding claim totals.  Our office agrees 
with the DOTAX approach insofar as the exemption applies to sales 
to individuals only and individual buyers are likely not reselling 
prescription drugs or prosthetics.  We note, however, that some 
taxpayers in fact claimed the exemption under the wholesale rate.  As 
our office is not at liberty to recharacterize the nature of a transaction 
as reported by a taxpayer, we calculated expenditure by using a mix of 
retail and wholesale rate claims.  For each year, we multiplied 4 percent 
by the retail claim amount and 0.5 percent by the wholesale claim 
amount, and summed the two arithmetic products. 
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, do the benefits outweigh the costs of this exemption?
As discussed above, there should be a benefit to those consumers to 
the extent tax savings are passed to end consumers.  Drug prices have 
risen, such that the tax benefit should, in turn, have grown.  During the 
five-year period of 2015 through 2019, the annual cost of prescription 
drug treatment increased by 26.3 percent in Hawai‘i, while the annual 
10 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    25
average income for State residents grew by only 10.5 percent.  During 
the six-year period of 2012 through 2017, the most prescribed drug in 
Hawai‘i, atorvastatin (better known by its generic name Lipitor), saw 
its price rise by 137 percent.  As of 2021, inflation in the U.S. average 
price of Lipitor surpassed the global median of national averages by 
approximately 2,200 percent, making Lipitor the drug with the third-
highest U.S. inflation rate relative to the rest of the world.  
Despite the rise in drug prices and corresponding increase in tax 
savings, the ultimate value of the benefit remains relatively low 
inasmuch as Hawai‘i – despite high prices – boasts the lowest per capita 
out-of-pocket expenditure on prescription drugs.  On average, a Hawai‘i 
resident spends only $82.08 per year on prescription drugs. 
Should this exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for prescription drugs and 
prosthetic devices be retained without modification.  While low out-
of-pocket costs appear caused more by insurance coverage and low 
incidence rates than by any tax exemption, retaining the exemption 
should help maintain the low-cost status quo.  Repealing the exemption, 
by contrast, could cause a rise in prices, and given the purpose of 
reducing costs to final purchasers and alleviating the high cost of living 
in Hawai‘i, we see no reason for any statutory modification. 26    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET the dues received by an 
unincorporated merchants association from its members to promote 
and advertise the association for the benefit of all its members as a 
whole.  More specifically, the exemption applies to dues received for 
“advertising media, promotional, and advertising costs,” including 
dues received as reimbursements of those costs.  The advertising and 
promotional costs must also be for the benefit of all members of the 
association.  The exemption specifically disqualifies costs to benefit 
a particular member or group of members comprising less than the 
whole.  Dues that the merchants association uses for other purposes, 
including to cover other association-related costs, are not exempt 
from GET under this provision.  
How the Exemption is Claimed
A merchants association receiving dues to cover qualified advertising 
and promotional costs reports the revenues on Schedule GE, under 
Exemptions/Deductions (ED) Code 129, “Merchants’ Association 
Dues (§237-24.3(8)).”  Although the dues revenues are reported, they 
are subtracted from the association’s gross income on the periodic 
G-45 and the annual G-49.  No GET should be owed on the relevant 
revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise 
substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because 
revenues from association dues must be reported on Schedule GE, 
data exists to quantify tax expenditure.General Excise Tax Exemption for Merchants Association

11 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    27
What is the purpose of this exemption?
This exemption was enacted to ensure that dues to cover promotional 
and advertising costs be exempt from GET.  It is a general principle 
that, in the context of an association, corporation, or legal person 
that has members or shareholders, the reimbursement of costs or 
advances made for or on behalf of one person by another should 
not be taxable.  Consistent with that principle, in 1968, DOTAX 
advised the Ala Moana Center Association that such dues were non-
taxable reimbursements.  In 1973, DOTAX advised the Pearlridge 
Center Association the same.  In 1979, however, DOTAX issued 
Tax Information Release (TIR) 67-79, which superseded the earlier 
opinions and asserted such dues were subject to GET.  This exemption, 
enacted in 1986, overruled that TIR, reasserting that such dues are to 
be exempt.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Yes, the exemption is meeting its purpose of ensuring that merchant 
association dues to cover promotional and advertising costs remain 
exempt from GET.  Whether the exemption is redundant in light 
of a possible preexisting exclusion, as discussed in the expenditure 
paragraphs below, does not affect the fact that the exemption, by its 
operation, furthers its intended purpose.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 30, 24, 9, and 8 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $17,864,000, $12,696,000, $7,569,000, and $6,864,000, 
respectively.
When determining the tax expenditure corresponding to this 
exemption, DOTAX appears to treat all the underlying transactions 
as wholesale transactions and calculates the amount of the tax 
expenditure using the wholesale GET rate.  That is, DOTAX assumes 
that, were the association dues subject to GET, the association would 
pay the wholesale rate of 0.5 percent on the membership dues – 
eightfold lower than the 4 percent rate applicable to retail transactions.  
By contrast, we calculate the amount of the tax expenditure (i.e., the 
loss of tax revenue to the State) based on the tax rate that taxpayers 
actually reported when claiming the exemption, and over 99 percent of 
claims reflected the 4 percent retail rate.  Hence, our tax expenditure 
values are roughly eight times those of DOTAX.28    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is no readily available data demonstrating any causal relationship 
between this exemption and employment or economic statistics.  
However, the effect of the exemption is to prevent GET imposition 
upon dues that, immediately prior to the exemption, were taxable.  
Consequently, there is an economic benefit in the form of GET savings 
to the merchants associations.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend retention of this exemption.  It is meeting its purpose of 
ensuring that association dues intended to cover association advertising 
remain untaxed by GET, overruling a Tax Information Release with 
which the Legislature disagreed.  While at first glance the exemption 
might appear superfluous in light of the principle that an association’ s 
cost reimbursements by its members be GET-free, the TIR triggered the 
need for the exemption to achieve that goal.

What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET income received by a labor 
organization from leasing real property to another labor organization 
or to a trust fund established by a labor organization for the benefit of 
its members and their families and dependents.  The claimant labor 
organization  must be qualified as an Internal Revenue Code Section 
501(c)(5) non-profit organization.  Among other things, that means the 
organization’s earnings must not inure to the benefit of any particular 
member, and its goals must be the betterment of the conditions of 
those engaged in labor, agriculture, or horticulture, the improvement of 
the grade of related products, and improved efficiency in those fields.
How the Exemption is Claimed
A labor organization reports its qualified rental income on  
Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions (ED) Code 125, “Labor 
Organizations  (§237-24.3( 9)).”  Although the revenues are reported, 
they are subtracted from the labor organization’s total revenues on the

14 We note that the exemption was enacted as part of Section 237-24, HRS, but is 
referenced in later law as part of Section 237-24.3, HRS.  This appears to imply that 
the section went through a renumbering, similar to the renumbering cited for other 
exemptions discussed earlier in this report.  Much renumbering of Section 237-24 to 
Section 237-24.3 occurred in Act 220, SLH 1993, but that Act excluded mention of 
this particular exemption for labor organizations.30    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat is the purpose of this exemption?
The purpose of this exemption is to counteract a U.S. Supreme Court 
case that affected labor organizations’ funding – to promote the 
activities of, and allow flexibility in the operations of, organized labor.  
In Communications Workers v. Beck , 487 U.S. 735 (1988), the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that trade unions could not collect dues for any 
purpose other than collective bargaining.  Consequently, unions saw 
their collections curtailed and testified in support of tax relief.  This 
exemption is an example of relief extended to the unions.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Given that the purpose of this exemption is to promote organized labor 
generally, it would appear to be meeting its purpose.  Ultimately, the 
tax exemption resulted in less tax due from labor organizations.  Lower 
taxes for the organizations should facilitate the continuing of such 
organizations’ activities, functions, and operational flexibility.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 22, 23, 13, and 15 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $47,295,000, $47,535,000, $282,000, and $298,000, respectively.  
Our figures coincide roughly with those of DOTAX, as both we and 
DOTAX applied the 4 percent retail rate to all transactions.  All claims 
for this exemption were made at the retail rate.

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
While we lack data showing any causal relationship between claims 
for this exemption and any economic or employment impact on the 
Hawai‘i economy, we suspect that the exemption has negligible or no 
impact on the State due to the low amount claimed.  As of 2021, the 
amount claimed was only $282,000, signifying about $11,000 in State 
expenditure – or a cost of $0.02 per low-income resident.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend retaining this exemption.  The provision meets its 
purpose of promoting the activities and functions of organized labor, 
by exempting lease revenues and thereby increasing funds available to 
associations.32    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

16 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET amounts received by the operator 
of the Hawai‘i Convention Center for reimbursements of costs or 
advances made pursuant to a contract with the Hawai‘i Tourism 
Authority (HTA).  It applies only to the entity contracted by HTA to 
operate the Hawai‘i Convention Center, meaning no other taxpayer 
is able to exempt revenue under this provision, including entities 
receiving reimbursements under contracts with HTA .  It also applies 
to payments only from HTA, meaning the convention center operator 
cannot exempt from GET any reimbursements it might receive from 
private persons or other governmental bodies.
How the Exemption is Claimed
The operator of the Hawai‘i Convention Center reports revenues that 
it intends to exempt on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions 
(ED) Code 121, “Hawaii Convention Center Operator.”  The revenues 
are thus reported, but are subtracted out – via Schedule GE and the 
periodic G-45 – prior to calculating the amount of revenue subject to 
GET.  No GET should be owed on the exempted revenues.
What is the purpose of this exemption?
The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that payments from HTA to 
the Hawai‘i Convention Center operator are not reduced by GET.  HTA 
contracts with the operator, to whom the HTA reimburses the costs of 
operating and marketing the center.  The payments are not payments 
for services, but are reimbursements mandated by rules of the special 
fund through which the moneys flow.  If those amounts were subject to General Excise Tax Exemption for the Hawai‘i Convention

GET, then the operator – by having to pay tax – would have fewer funds 
than designated for operating and marketing the facility.  Eliminating 
the tax ensures that no such reduction in funds occur.
That last point could best be illustrated by a few numbers mentioned 
explicitly by the Legislature in the Act establishing the exemption.  At 
the time of enactment, the operator had received $16 million in cost 
advances and reimbursements, upon which DOTAX sought to impose 
a $700,000 tax.  The Legislature indicated that the $700,000, going 
toward GET, could not be used by the operator to cover expenses.  
Indeed, the operator would not even be able to cover the tax with its true 
compensation, which was only $500,000, presumably meaning that the 
operator would have to use at least some of its reimbursement moneys 
to pay tax.  In short, the exemption was enacted to ensure that the 
special fund function as it was legally required to work – that moneys 
from the fund be used only to cover convention center operational 
expenses, and not to pay tax.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Yes, the exemption is meeting its purpose.  It allows all reimbursement 
moneys paid from HTA to be used to cover expenses for which they 
were issued.  
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
This exemption is for the convention center operator only, such that, 
for any year in which there is only one operator, there should be only 
one claim of this exemption.  Indeed, for 2021 and 2020, DOTAX 
suppressed disclosure of data relating to this exemption because there 
were fewer than 5 claimants.  It is DOTAX policy to withhold the 
number of taxpayers claiming an incentive when that number is five 
or fewer.  That is to prevent readers from being able to identify any 
particular taxpayer and thus protect confidential taxpayer information.
With regard to tax year 2019, our expenditure differs from that of 
DOTAX because we apply the 4 percent retail rate of tax, while 
DOTAX applies the 0.5 percent wholesale rate.  As detailed previously 
in this report, we disagree with the approach that business-to-business 
transactions ought to be characterized as wholesale transactions 
regardless of how taxpayers, themselves, characterized their own 
transactions.  To apply one rate when a taxpayer has identified another 
as applicable is tantamount to recharacterizing the transaction, and while 
DOTAX in its enforcement capacity may be authorized to take such 
action, we are not. 34    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
We lack the data necessary to determine whether this exemption has any 
economic impact upon the State.  Without amounts claimed, numbers 
of claimants, or expenditure values, and no performance benchmarks 
or other metrics identified in Section 237-24.75(2), HRS, we cannot 
conduct a cost-benefit analysis, estimate any direct employment impact, 
or otherwise calculate the economic effects of the exemption.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the Hawai‘i Convention Center operator GET 
exemption enacted at Section 237-24.75(2), HRS, be retained.  
At least one taxpayer – and presumably only one taxpayer, the 
Convention Center Operator – is claiming the exemption, which means 
reimbursements from the HTA are not being reduced by any need to 
pay GET.  Keeping such reimbursements free from reduction by tax, the 
exemption is meeting its legislative purpose.

Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesincome and employer organizations would owe GET on the same dollars 
passed to them to cover wages.  The elimination of double taxation is 
further explored in our section on this exemption’s purpose, below.
A professional employer organization, for purposes of the exemption, 
means an organization that contracts with client companies to provide 
that company with long-term employees, and specifically excludes 
companies providing temporary help services or similar short-term 
employment services.  Only those amounts received by the professional 
employer organization from a client company that were disbursed by the 
professional employer organization to cover employee wages, salaries, 
payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and benefits such as retirement, 
vacation, and sick pay are exempt from GET.  The exemption does 
not apply if the professional employer organization has not fulfilled or 
maintained registration requirements or failed to pay any withholding 
taxes with respect to the covered employees.
How the Exemption is Claimed
A professional employer organization reports wage reimbursement 
revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions (ED)  
Code 137, “Professional Employer Organizations  (§237-24.75(3)) .”  
Although relevant revenues are reported, they are subtracted from the 
business’s total revenues on the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49.   
No GET should be owed on the relevant revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise substantiate 
the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because revenues 
associated with the exemption must be reported on Schedule GE, data 
exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What is the purpose of this exemption?
This exemption was part of a larger package of provisions – Act 225,  
SLH 2007 – whose collective purpose was to make outsourcing of 
employment and payroll more cost-effective for Hawai‘i’s small 
business owners, while protecting employee rights.  The particular 
cost savings embodied by the GET exemption is the elimination of 
double taxation.  Without the exemption, there would be two levels 
of general excise taxation on the same income, as follows: first, GET  
would apply to revenues recognized by the employer client of the 
professional employer organization, from whatever services or products 
the client sells; second, GET would apply to revenues recognized by the 
professional employer organization itself, from its selling hiring services 
to the client – and including any wage reimbursements.  The provision 
exempts the wage reimbursements, thus eliminating double taxation to 
the extent of those amounts.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    37
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
The direct beneficiaries of the exemption are the professional employer 
organizations receiving reimbursements for the wages paid to employees 
assigned to clients.  Indirectly, clients of such organizations benefit to 
the extent GET is not passed on to them.  Ultimately, the benefit to the 
client means that the exemption appears to be achieving its purposes.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 42, 43, 52, and 63 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $72,433,000, $181,867,000, $183,366,000, and $251,451,000 
respectively.  Over 99 percent of claims for this exemption were made at 
the retail rate, a fact for which our expenditure calculation accounts.

Note that the DOTAX expenditure value with respect to this exemption, 
for each of the last four years, is $0.  This implies that DOTAX 
considers the incentive to be an exclusion, as opposed to exemption – 
meaning no GET was intended to apply or would be collected even were 
the exemption repealed.  We disagree with that understanding of the tax 
incentive, as prior to the exemption the relevant reimbursements were, 
in fact, taxed.  The Legislature enacted the exemption specifically to 
carve out the reimbursements from taxable income, and thereby prevent 
double taxation, as previously discussed.
We are aware of a separate, statutory exclusionary rule applicable to 
reimbursements, but we believe such rule should not apply with respect 
to the specific category of income covered by this exemption.  Codified 
19 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.38    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesat Section 237-20, HRS, is a general principle that reimbursements 
of costs or advances made for or on behalf of another shall not 
constitute gross income of that person – meaning such income will 
be excluded and not reportable.  However, that rule is tempered by 
two limitations, both of which should prevent it from applying to the 
revenues covered by this incentive.  First, the Section 237-20 principle 
appears in the context of companies or other legal persons receiving 
reimbursements from their constituents – such as a corporation 
reimbursed by its own shareholders or an association reimbursed by 
its members.  Here, the income is not flowing from a constituent to 
a whole, but from a purchaser of services to an entirely unrelated 
seller.  Second, the principle, by its own language later in the statute, 
does not apply when the person receiving the reimbursement also 
receives additional monetary consideration for covering the relevant 
costs or advances.  Here, the professional employer organization, in 
addition to receiving reimbursements, is paid an additional amount for 
its services, which include the payment of employee compensation.  
Ultimately, the exclusionary rule for reimbursements should not apply 
to reimbursements to professional employer organizations from those 
organizations’ clients.
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is insufficient data readily available to draw any conclusion as to 
whether this exemption has been the cause of any economic activity, or 
lack thereof, in the State.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the exemption for professional employer 
organizations be retained.  It appears to be meeting its intended purpose 
without any significant adverse effect.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    39

20 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.These exemptions were enacted as a part of  
Act 78, SLH 1986, in which the Legislature 
asserted that there were certain areas in the State 
needing particular attention of government to help 
attract private-sector investment.  These areas, or 
“Enterprise Zones,” are meant to be major economic 
development tools to help bring business and 
employment opportunities to otherwise economically challenged areas.  Eligible businesses located 
within an Enterprise Zone and that meet hiring 
requirements are exempt from GET and may claim 
personal or corporate non-refundable income tax 
and state unemployment premium credits, among 
other benefits.  Counties can also offer additional 
incentives, such as incremental property tax relief, 
priority permit processing, or fee waivers.

Act 78, SLH 1986, enacted the 
provision as part of an entirely 
new HRS Chapter on State 
Enterprise Zones.
1989
Act 390, SLH 1989
• Defined and delimited key 
terms, notably including 
“qualified business” and 
“service business or calling;”
• Updated U.S. census 
references to reflect the then-
upcoming census of 1990;
• Required the DBEDT to 
consult the DOTAX in adopting Enterprise Zone 
rules; 
• Reduced for Enterprise 
Zone business qualification 
the employee growth 
requirement from 10 percent 
to 5 percent, but required

year over year;
• Required for Enterprise 
Zone business qualification 
that products sold in an 
Enterprise Zone have their 
transfer of title and delivery 
occur within the Enterprise

wholesale sale of tangible 
personal property, or the 
engaging of a service 
business or calling. 
While most of the above 
changes enacted by Act 390

What does this exemption provision do?
This provision exempts from GET the revenue from activities in an 
Enterprise Zone by two distinct types of business: a business qualified 
by the Hawai‘i Department of Business, Economic Development and 
Tourism (DBEDT) as an Enterprise Zone business and a licensed 
construction contractor. 
Enterprise Zone Businesses
The first of the two exemptions in Section 209E-11, HRS, applies 
to businesses operating within an Enterprise Zone.  The law allows 
qualified businesses in an Enterprise Zone not to have to pay GET  
on proceeds from eligible business activities undertaken in the 
same county as that zone.  What businesses qualify, and which 
activities are eligible, are identified by other sections of the HRS 
Chapter on Enterprise Zones, as follows.
A business is a “qualified business” for exemption purposes if it is 
so authorized by DBEDT, which requires that the business engage 
in eligible business activity in an Enterprise Zone, attribute at least 
50 percent of its gross receipts to operations within Enterprise 
Zones in the same county, and meet one of two additional growth 
requirements, depending on whether it is an agricultural or non-
agricultural business.  The additional growth requirement for an 
agricultural business is a rise of at least two percent in gross sales 
of agricultural products produced or processed within Enterprise 
Zones in the same county as the Enterprise Zone of operations.  
The additional growth requirement for a non-agricultural business 
is a rise of at least ten percent in average number of full-time 
employees over the first year within Enterprise Zones in the same 
county as the Enterprise Zone in which the business primarily 
operates.  The business must also maintain the new, heightened 
level of employment, during each successive year.  In the case 
of any business selling physical goods or services, the items sold 
must also be sold within an Enterprise Zone – and, in the case of 
goods, that Enterprise Zone and the Enterprise Zone in which title 
transfers must all be within the same county.  Finally, to remain 
qualified year after year, any qualified business must submit and 
have approved by DBEDT annual applications for recertification.
Eligible business activity is defined by an exhaustive list of 
qualifying activities.  Eligible activities are prescriptively limited to:
•	The manufacture or wholesale sale of tangible personal 
property;
•	Services in the repair of ships, aircraft, or assisted technology 
equipment, or in the fields of telecommunications, 
information technology design and production, medicine, 
healthcare, education, or training;42    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes•	Genetically-engineered medical, agricultural, or maritime 
biotechnology product research, development, sale, or 
production;
•	Wind energy production for sale to a public utility; and
•	Agricultural production or processing within an enterprise 
zone, except that retail sales of non-genetically-engineered 
agricultural products are not exempt.
Statutorily excluded are any activities of a medical cannabis 
dispensary, regardless of whether such activities would otherwise 
qualify.
The exemption can be claimed for up to seven years only or, 
in the case of manufacturing or the producing or processing of 
agricultural products, for up to ten years.
Enterprise Zone Construction Contractors
The second of the exemptions in Section 209E-11, HRS, is for 
income from Enterprise Zone construction within an Enterprise 
Zone.  Income received by a contractor for construction work is 
exempt from GET, provided that the contractor is Hawai‘i-licensed 
and the work is performed in an Enterprise Zone for an Enterprise 
Zone qualified business.
How the Exemptions are Claimed
With respect to claims by qualified businesses, taxpayers report 
revenues that they intend to exempt on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/
Deductions (ED) Code 115, “Enterprise Zones (§209E-11).”  The 
revenues are thus reported, but are subtracted out – via Schedule GE and 
the periodic G-45 – prior to calculating the amount of GET owed.  No 
GET should be owed on the relevant revenues.
With respect to claims by construction contractors serving qualified 
businesses, taxpayers report in precisely the same way, but under 
ED Code 107, “Contracting Activity in an Enterprise Zone ( §209E-
11).”   The two exemptions – one for qualified businesses and one for 
construction contractors – are tracked separately by DOTAX.
What is the purpose of these exemptions?
The purpose of the Enterprise Zone program was to stimulate business 
and industrial growth in areas where such would result in neighborhood 
revitalization.  Such growth was to be accomplished by regulatory 
flexibility and tax incentives, with these exemptions as incentives 
provided under the program.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    43
Are the exemptions meeting their purpose?
We cannot determine from data available whether either GET exemption 
is meeting its purpose.  DBEDT annually publishes a report evaluating 
the effectiveness of the Enterprise Zone program and providing related 
recommendations to the Governor, but it is unclear from the DBEDT 
reports how much, if at all, the GET exemption stimulated business and 
industrial growth in areas needing revitalization.  In 2022, DBEDT-
certified Enterprise Zone companies reported 855 new or maintained 
jobs statewide, signifying a decline from the 1,113 reported in 2021.  
DBEDT attributed much of the decline to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and the report does not evaluate the extent to which jobs created 
and maintained impacted the economic vitality of their surrounding 
Enterprise Zone.  Secondly, there is no way to segregate any impact 
caused by the GET exemption under Section 209E-11 from any 
impact caused by the rest of the Enterprise Zone program – notably 
the Enterprise Zone income tax credit allowed under Section 209E-10, 
HRS.  There are also no benchmarks or performance targets for the 
Enterprise Zone exemption established in Section 209E-11.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for these exemptions from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 192, 187, 169, and 149 GET filings claiming the 
exemptions in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each 
of those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under 
the exemptions was $476,140,000, $471,695,000, $440,397,000, 
and $254,851,000, respectively.  Over 88 percent of claims for the 
exemptions were made at the wholesale rate, for which our expenditure 
calculation accounts.44    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

We note that DOTAX appears to calculate the expenditure for ED 115, 
pertaining to qualified businesses, differently from how it calculates 
that for ED 107, pertaining to contractors.  With respect to qualified 
businesses claiming the exemption for operating in an Enterprise Zone, 
DOTAX uses the retail rate only – for all such claimants.  Implicit in 
the use of the retail rate is an assumption that all such businesses are 
selling to end consumers only.  With respect to construction contractors, 
by contrast, DOTAX appears to assume that all contractors are selling 
to buyers who are not end consumers.  It applies the wholesale rate to 
expenditure calculations with respect to contractors. 
21 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    45
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemptions?
The DBEDT annual Enterprise Zone report from 2022 shows that 
Enterprise Zone companies claiming the exemptions have created or 
maintained jobs, but we cannot determine to what extent there is or is 
not a causal connection between such job creation and the exemptions.  
According to the report, Enterprise Zone companies reported creating or 
maintaining 1,113 jobs in 2021.  Forgone revenue from Enterprise Zone 
GET exemptions for the same year totaled $4,442,913.  Hence, even 
excluding the expenditure of any Enterprise Zone income tax credits, 
the GET exemptions cost the State $3,992 per job.  Based on DOTAX 
expenditure values above, the cost per job rises to $15,062.  Factoring in 
Enterprise Zone income tax expenditures would only raise the cost per 
job further.  DBEDT has stated the cost per job of the income tax credit 
and a related GET exemption, combined, has been fairly consistent 
in past years, never exceeding $2,500.  However, DBEDT assumes 
the wholesale rate for all related transactions and does not factor in 
construction contractor claims under exemption/deduction code 107.  
Should the exemptions be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We lack sufficient adequately reliable data and analysis to determine 
whether the tax credit should be retained, substantively amended, 
or repealed.  The ultimate goal of the exemption is to revitalize 
neighborhoods, a goal we understand to imply job growth and job 
maintenance.  While the rate of job growth in Enterprise Zones has 
decreased, DBEDT attributes that decline to COVID-19 – and jobs 
have consistently grown or been maintained.  Unfortunately, we cannot 
determine to what extent the decrease may be due to an exemption 
or another cause.  Additionally, the Legislature did not include 
performance criteria for measuring achievement of the purpose of 
the exemptions.  Ultimately, to what extent the exemptions motivate 
business growth in Enterprise Zones is something we cannot determine.46    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024Appendix ASections 23-71 through 23-81, HRS

Impact on Low-Income Residents and Hawai‘i Residents
Section 23-71, HRS, also requires us to estimate the “annual cost of the exemption [or] exclusion ... per 
low-income resident of the State.”  The statute defines “low-income resident” as a state resident who is 
(1) the only member of a family of one and has an income of not more than 80 percent of the area median 
income for a family of one; or (2) part of a family with an income of not more than 80 percent of the area 
median income for a family of the same size.  Applying that definition, we find an estimated 480,801 “low-
income residents” statewide in 2020 based on data provided by the Department of Business, Economic 
Development and Tourism.  Using that number of low-income residents, we calculate the cost of each 
exemption per low-income resident, included in the table below.
We also include in the table below the cost of each exemption per Hawai‘i resident, regardless of income 
level.  Such cost is calculated using Hawai‘i’s 2022 resident population of 1,440,196 people.  The results 
in the table below follow and include the Auditor’s tax expenditure estimates only; they do not factor in 
DOTAX expenditure estimates.

OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR
STATE OF HAWAI‘I
Constitutional Mandate
Pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the Hawai‘i State Constitution, the
Office of the Auditor shall conduct post-audits of the transactions, accounts, 
programs and performance of all departments, offices and agencies of the 
State and its political subdivisions.
The Auditor’s position was established to help eliminate waste and 
inefficiency in government, provide the Legislature with a check against the 
powers of the executive branch, and ensure that public funds are expended 
according to legislative intent.
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, Chapter 23, gives the Auditor broad powers to 
examine all books, records, files, papers and documents, and financial 
affairs of every agency.  The Auditor also has the authority to summon 
people to produce records and answer questions under oath.
Our Mission
To improve government through independent and objective analyses.
We provide independent, objective, and meaningful answers to questions 
about government performance.  Our aim is to hold agencies accountable 
for their policy implementation, program management, and expenditure of 
public funds.
Our Work
We conduct performance audits (also called management or operations 
audits), which examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government 
programs or agencies, as well as financial audits, which attest to the 
fairness of financial statements of the State and its agencies.
Additionally, we perform procurement audits, sunrise analyses and sunset 
evaluations of proposed regulatory programs, analyses of proposals to 
mandate health insurance benefits, analyses of proposed special and 
revolving funds, analyses of existing special, revolving and trust funds, and 
special studies requested by the Legislature.
We report our findings and make recommendations to the governor and the 
Legislature to help them make informed decisions.

Section 23-71, HRS, requires the Auditor to review a variety of tax 
incentives identified in later sections of the chapter and outlines what, 
substantively, the Auditor is to analyze.  Section 23-76, HRS, identifies 
the specific exemptions and exclusions to be reviewed in 2023.  We 
review other tax incentives in other reports, and a list of which 
incentives will be reviewed in which year may be found in Appendix A.   
The exemptions and exclusions discussed in this report are to be 
revisited pursuant to a 10-year review cycle under Section 23-76, HRS.
Background
Hawai‘i’s GET applies to nearly all business activities in Hawai‘i.  In 
FY2022, which ended June 30, 2022, GET and Use Tax revenues 
summed to $4 billion, or nearly 38 percent of the total tax revenue from 
all sources.   
Lawmakers sometimes exclude or exempt certain revenues from 
taxation to promote social or economic goals, or for tax efficiency or 
equity.  Section 1 of Act 261, Session Laws of Hawai‘i (SLH) 2016, 
which established the annual review of GET, Use Tax, Public Service 
Company Tax, and Insurance Premium Tax exemptions, exclusions, and 
credits, noted that such provisions reduce revenue to the State.  That 
results in a need for all taxpayers, including those who do not directly 
benefit from such tax breaks, to compensate for the reduced revenue, or 
alternatively, the government must reduce spending on state programs.  
Despite the loss of revenue, the Legislature has stated that certain tax 
exemptions, exclusions, and credits are worthy of continuation for 
equity, efficiency, and economic and social policy purposes.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    3
Accordingly, the Legislature found the Auditor’s periodic reviews 
“necessary to promote tax equity and efficiency, adequacy of 
state revenues, public transparency, and confidence in a fair state 
government.”  Unfortunately, for most of the provisions now under 
review, neither the law nor the relevant legal history includes specific 
outcomes that the Legislature sought to achieve.  The Legislature has 
not articulated the purpose of each provision nor has it identified criteria 
against which to measure each provision.  Our mandate under which we 
conduct these reviews instructs us to determine the extent to which each 
provision achieves its purpose – a task made difficult when provisions 
fail to specify a purpose or a means by which to measure whether the 
purpose has been achieved.
We recommend the Legislature clearly articulate the purpose of each 
tax provision and establish specific metrics to measure the provision’ s 
effectiveness, which will permit a more thorough and meaningful 
analysis when we review these provisions in the future.  We further 
recommend that the Enterprise Zone exemptions be split from one 
section into two sections of the HRS, or otherwise separated, to 
delineate clearly between the two exemptions and reduce confusion 
regarding calculations related to their associated tax expenditures – as 
discussed in the Enterprise Zone exemption portion later in this report.
Hawai‘i’s General Excise Tax and Use Tax
Hawai‘i’s GET and Use Tax, together, ensure that the State of Hawai‘i 
will reap at least some benefit, in the form of tax revenue, from business 
operations in the State.  This is accomplished primarily by GET, a tax on 
the privilege of doing business in Hawai‘i and the largest source of tax 
revenue in the State.  For the privilege of doing business in the State of 
Hawai‘i, a business must pay GET – a tax separate from, and in addition 
to, income tax.  Unlike income tax, GET is a flat tax, meaning the rate 
of tax does not change with income level.  It is also a tax on product 
values, gross sales proceeds, and gross income receipts, meaning the tax 
ignores business expenses.  It applies to nearly every product or service 
sold in Hawai‘i.  GET does not apply, however, to out-of-state sellers.  
That is where the Use Tax applies. 
Use Tax complements GET by taxing goods and services imported for 
use in Hawai‘i and sold by sellers not already subject to GET.  It “levels 
the playing field” between buying from those subject to GET and those 
not subject to GET – often meaning local and out-of-state businesses, 
respectively.  One nuanced distinction between GET and Use Tax is that 
GET is usually assessed against gross proceeds or gross income, while 
Use Tax is assessed on the purchase price or value of the good or service 4    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesused.  Another distinction is that sellers typically pay GET, whereas 
purchasers or importers, depending on how the import is used, pay  
Use Tax. 
Reporting for GET and Use Tax is accomplished via the filing of a 
return: the “General Excise/Use Tax Return.”  There are two types of 
General Excise/Use Tax Returns: periodic and annual. 
The G-45 (Periodic Return):
Throughout the tax year, an individual or business subject to 
GET or Use Tax must file periodic GET/Use Tax returns, each 
of which is known as a Form G-45.  Periodic returns may be due 
semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly, depending on how much the 
taxpayer estimates it will owe in GET, over the course of the year.  
The higher a taxpayer’s gross income, the more the taxpayer will 
likely owe and the more frequently it should have to file.  Large 
enterprises with high revenues typically file monthly, while small 
enterprises are likely to file semi-annually.
Electronic filing of the G-45 is mandatory for all filers owing 
more than $4,000 in GET for a given year.  That means all 
monthly filers, including high-revenue businesses and import-
heavy businesses must file electronically.  As of April 9, 2024, we 
have found no law or guidance specifically requiring electronic 
filing for filers owing $4,000 or less, though the Department of 
Taxation (DOTAX) has announced that it may phase in more 
electronic filing mandates in the future.  Electronic filing of a 
G-45 is accomplished via the Hawai‘i Tax Online system.
The G-49 (Annual Return):
At the end of the tax year, all individuals or businesses subject to 
either GET or Use Tax file the annual GET/Use Tax return and 
reconciliation, or Form G-49.  The annual return should equal 
the sum of all the periodic returns, meaning the G-49 and the 
aggregate of the year’s G-45s should “reconcile” against each 
other.
Electronic filing is mandated for all G-49 filers.  Electronic filing 
of a G-49 is accomplished via DOTAX’s Hawai‘i Tax Online 
system.  Hawai‘i Tax Online is a resource that allows taxpayers to 
manage their tax accounts online.
There are ancillary GET and Use Tax forms, beyond the G-45 and 
G-49, that must be filed under certain circumstances.  An important 
one, for purposes of this review, is Schedule GE on which taxpayers 
claim exemptions and deductions.  It accompanies a G-45 or G-49 as 
a schedule attached to the return, and failing to include it will result     Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    5
in disallowance of the exemption or deduction.  Other forms beyond 
Schedule GE, the G-45, and the G-49, unless specifically discussed 
elsewhere in this report, are beyond the scope of our current review.
It is the position of DOTAX that an exclusion applies to revenue that 
was never meant to be taxable.  As GET is a tax on the privilege of 
doing business, revenues that are not from business activities are 
typically excluded – either by default or under a specific exclusion 
enacted toward that end.  Real estate is a classic example: revenues from 
the sale of real estate might be subject to income tax (as capital gains) 
but are not subject to GET.  It is the business of selling or buying real 
estate, meaning the commissions earned from real estate sales, that is 
GET-taxable.1  Taxpayers generally do not report excluded amounts 
to DOTAX, such that DOTAX cannot capture related information.  
Consequently, DOTAX does not report data on exclusions.  
Rates at a Glance
While GET is a tax on business income, it resembles a consumption 
tax or sales tax in that the cost is typically passed along to consumers.    
However, GET is distinct from a typical sales tax in that it is a tax on 
businesses, whereas a sales tax is a tax on consumers  that is collected 
by a business.  GET is also distinct in that it is assessed on nearly 
every business transaction – wholesale and retail, goods and services – 
resulting in a broad tax base.  By contrast, a typical sales tax applies to 
retail sales of tangible goods only.  
Retailing includes the selling of tangible personal property for end 
consumption or use by the purchaser – as opposed to selling for resale 
purposes – as well as the renting of tangible personal property and the 
rendering of services by a service business.  For example, a farmer’s 
market vendor selling mangoes to passers-by to eat should be taxed 
at the retail rate.  Wholesaling includes a business’s selling goods or 
services to another business for resale.  Were that same market vendor to 
sell to a store owner who sold the mangoes to the store’s customers, the 
vendor should be taxed at the wholesale rate.
For tax year 2023, GET rates were as follows:  
• 0.15 percent on commissions from insurance sales;  
• 0.5 percent on revenue received by manufacturers and 
wholesalers, as defined by statute and as discussed later in this 
report; and  
1 See sidebar, “Tax Expenditures: At What ‘Cost’?” on page 13 for a detailed explana -
tion of tax expenditures.6    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes• 4.0 percent on revenue received from all other activities including, 
but not limited to, the retail sale of tangible personal property 
(goods) or services, construction contracting, renting or leasing 
real or personal property, business interest income, commissions 
(except insurance commissions), and theaters and amusements.  
For tax year 2023  Use Tax rates were as follows:
Wholesale-to-Wholesale
0.0 percent (no tax) on the use of goods or value of services 
imported by GET-licensed wholesalers and on other items for other 
importers subject to the wholesale GET rate;
Wholesale-to-Retail and Certain Others
0.5 percent on the use of goods or value of services imported by 
GET-licensed retailers, publishing, certain professional services, and 
the furnishing of transient accommodations; and
Retail-to-End Consumers and All Others
4.0 percent on the value transacted in all other cases of goods and 
services imports, and in all cases of intangible property imports.
As the rates above illustrate, manufacturers, wholesalers, and, in the 
case of Use Tax, resellers, benefit from lower rates.  Consequently, 
whether a taxpayer qualifies for any of the above rates is of critical 
importance to determining GET and Use Tax liability.
County Public Transportation Surcharges  
(Chapters 237, 238, and 248, HRS)    
Since 2007, the City and County of Honolulu has imposed a 0.5 percent 
GET and Use Tax surcharge to help fund its public transportation 
system.  Hawai‘i, Kaua‘i, and Maui counties have also each adopted 
0.5 percent surcharges.  There is no surcharge on revenues exempt from 
GET or Use Tax.  Hence, in addition to reducing overall state revenue, 
exemptions and exclusions reduce county revenue.       Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    7
HAWAI‘I’S GET,  like most sales taxes across the 
country, is a product of the Great Depression.  
While the Territory of Hawai‘i did not experience 
the level of unemployment and economic distress 
experienced by more industrialized areas of the 
United States, falling land values during the early 
1930s led to a drop in real and personal property 
tax revenue, which were then the mainstays of 
the Hawai‘i tax structure.  In response, the 1932 
Territorial Legislature cut real property tax rates and 
repealed the levy on personal property.  To make 
up for the lost revenue, the Legislature adopted 
a business excise tax, which taxed the operating 
costs of each entity doing business in Hawai‘i.  In 
1935, the Legislature replaced the business excise 
tax with GET, a tax on gross proceeds.   
Containing elements of both business and 
consumption taxation, GET was designed to 
redistribute the tax burden to different industries 
and their consumers.2  Estimates prepared for the 
1935 House Finance Committee predicted that 
the sugar, ranching, and diversified agriculture 
industries would receive tax relief while the 
retail industry would experience the greatest tax 
increase.  Although the adoption could be viewed 
as a concession to some of Hawai‘i’s oldest and 
largest businesses, this change in tax policy may 
have been prophetic, as the Islands’ economy 
underwent fundamental changes.   
Even by 1939, the retailing industry was accounting 
for the Territory’s largest “taxable value,” or “tax 
base,” at $123.72 million, or 33 percent of the 
Territory’s total $376.71 million tax base.  At  
$41.60 million, sugar comprised 11 percent of  
the tax base, with pineapple close behind at  
$35.44 million, or 9 percent of the tax base.  
Meanwhile, the tax base for service industry 
businesses was just $17 million, or 4.5 percent of 
the total.  By Statehood in 1959, while all industries 
rose with the favorable economic tides, the gap 
between business and consumption tax bases grew 
wider.  Retailing’s tax base ballooned to  
$707.53 million (35 percent of the total tax base), 
2 Hawai‘i’s General Excise Tax , Report No. 2, 1963, 
Legislative Reference Bureau, State of Hawai‘i, p. 8. while services saw even greater growth at  
$160.49 million (8 percent of the total).   
Meanwhile, sugar and pineapple had tax bases of 
$93.42 million and $98.43 million respectively, with 
each comprising about 5 percent of the tax base.  
Today, the retailing and service industries are still 
the breadwinners for the state when it comes to 
GET.  For FY2023, DOTAX reported that retailing 
had a tax base of $47.55 billion, or 33.9 percent of 
the total tax base, with services at $20.18 billion, or 
14.4 percent of the tax base.  How We Got GET
General Excise Tax in Hawai‘i 
In FY2022, the State General Fund, which is the 
State’s chief operating fund, realized a total of  
$10.46 billion in tax collections.  Most of that  
revenue came from two taxes: GET and income tax.  
Income tax collections, which are comprised  
of both individual and corporate income tax 
revenues, represent Hawai‘i’s largest tax revenue 
source and accounted for $4.02 billion.  GET, the 
fund’s second largest tax revenue source, accounted 
for $4.01 billion, or 38.3 percent of total general fund 
tax revenue.  The Transient Accommodations Tax, 
the State’s third-largest revenue source, accounted 
for $739 million, or 7.1 percent.    Source: DOTAX Annual Report for fiscal year

Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesAnalysis of Reviewed Tax Provisions
What did we review?
This report reviews a total of eight tax provisions encompassing nine 
exemptions from GET, pursuant to Section 23-76, HRS.  One provision, 
regarding State of Hawai‘i Enterprise Zones, includes two exemptions: 
one for qualified Enterprise Zone businesses and one for contractors 
engaged in construction in Enterprise Zones.  Though they are reported 
by taxpayers to DOTAX separately, we review the two Enterprise 
Zone exemptions together to follow closely our mandate and issue a 
recommendation on the singular provision to which both relate.
Our analysis included reviewing confidential DOTAX taxpayer 
records under authority provided by Section 231-3.3, HRS, which 
was adopted under Act 177, SLH 2017, to facilitate our reviews.  That 
section requires that any information accessed by the Auditor remain 
confidential, with limited exceptions.  
What did we find?
We determined that six exemptions appear to be achieving what we 
understand to be their originally intended purposes.  We could not 
determine whether the remaining three exemptions (including the two 
Enterprise Zone exemptions combined under Section 209E-11, HRS) 
were achieving their purposes, primarily because of a lack of data 
regarding utilization and economic impact.  The statute requiring us to

Assessment Challenges:
Few Metrics on Purpose Achievement  
and No Data on Economic Impact
A significant challenge we encountered was the lack of any metrics by 
which to quantify or otherwise assess whether an exemption is meeting 
its purpose and how it is affecting, if at all, the State economy.  Our 
mandate at Section 23-71, HRS, requires that, with respect to any 
reviewed exemption enacted because of its purported economic or 
employment benefit, the Auditor quantify the benefit and comment on 
whether the benefit outweighs the cost of the exemption.  Our mandate 
does not provide criteria or other direction for identifying or quantifying 
the intended benefit, and – for most exemptions – businesses are not 
required to provide information on jobs created or other economic 
impact information to the State.  Additionally, most provisions reviewed 
in this report, like those reviewed in prior reports, do not include 
purpose statements or other explicit indications as to what their intended 
benefits were or are.  Our mandate does specify, however, that the 
purpose of an incentive may be “reasonably identified by the auditor .”  
Where possible, we considered House and Senate committee reports 
and other sources of legislative history to identify purpose and intended 
benefits, to the extent the Legislature discussed such before or during * Note: There are two Enterprise Zones exemptions written into Section 209E-11, HRS.  Both were 
analyzed together, as they relate to the same tax provision that the Auditor is mandated to review. 10    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesenactment.  Ultimately, we were able to calculate expenditure values 
from DOTAX data, but not the extent to which many of the exemptions 
affected the economy.  In short, we could usually measure the cost, but 
not the benefit, of an exemption.
Lack of Forecasting Tools and Data
Lack of current data and forecasting tools also hindered our ability to 
predict future tax expenditures.  Our mandate requires not only a review 
of past incentive performance, but also an estimation of tax expenditure 
for the current and next two calendar years.  The latest DOTAX 
and Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 
(DBEDT) data is from 2022, and our office does not have economic 
modeling software or similar tools for predictive calculations.  We also 
note that, according to DBEDT, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly 
impacted at least one exemption in this report, such that any trend 
mapped using data from 2022 and earlier might be of dubious reliability 
for future value estimations.  Even absent the pandemic, proving 
causality between an exemption and a rise or decline in any particular 
economic activity is not feasible without identifying and eliminating 
other potential causes.  Regarding job creation, for example, there is no 
readily available data proving or disproving that a business claiming an 
exemption and creating jobs would have created those jobs irrespective 
of any exemption claim.  Likewise, there is no data readily available 
regarding the economic impact of businesses ineligible to claim a 
particular exemption, or eligible businesses that elect not to claim an 
exemption to which they are entitled.
Use of Statutory Formula for Low-Income Resident 
Calculations
An additional concern is that we conducted an analysis of the impact 
of the tax provisions on “low-income residents” using a formula 
provided in the statute.  We question whether the calculations represent 
the “value” that repeal of a particular tax provision would have for 
low-income residents.  Although money generated from repealing a 
particular exemption or exclusion likely will increase tax revenues, the 
impact of the additional funds will not confer a benefit upon low-income 
residents in particular, but to all residents.  Further discussion on “low-
income resident” calculations can be found in Appendix B.
Undefined Terms
An additional concern is that the term tax expenditure  is not defined 
in Hawai‘i’s laws, including in Section 23-71, HRS, which mandates 
this review.  The following sidebar explains how tax exemptions 
and exclusions generally work, but as noted in previous reports, the 
Auditor and DOTAX have different interpretations of how to calculate     Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    11
a tax expenditure.  This report considers a tax expenditure to be the 
amount of tax revenue forgone as a result of a tax provision.  See “Tax 
Expenditures: At What ‘Cost’?” on page 13.  
Exclusions and Exemptions
TAX BREAKS to promote tax equity, efficiency, or various economic and social goals may allow money 
that would otherwise be spent on taxes to remain in the hands of taxpayers.  For example, taxpayers 
who own or operate businesses may use those tax savings to create jobs.  Other preferences may 
provide economic support to specific segments of society.
EXEMPTIONS COME AT A COST.   Allowing certain taxpayers to reduce the amount of gross revenues 
that are subject to GET decreases the amount of tax revenues that might otherwise be available for 
the State to spend.  While direct spending programs are subject to review through the budgetary 
process, moneys the State does not see can be more challenging to evaluate.  Identifying whether 
the benefits of tax exemptions outweigh their costs can be a complex endeavor , but such reviews can 
provide important information to legislators about the effectiveness of a tax preference and moneys 
that may be available for other state priorities.According to DOTAX, exclusions are tax law 
provisions that remove from tax reporting, 
entirely, revenues from activities never intended 
to be taxed.  Income that is excluded is not 
reported on a tax return, as if the income never 
existed for tax purposes.  As unreported, it is 
effectively ignored in tax calculations and not 
subject to taxation.EXCLUSIONS
Exemptions refer to revenues from taxable 
activities or goods that, for policy purposes, are not 
subject to taxation.  Income that is exempt typically 
is reported on a tax return or other tax record, but 
is subtracted out of taxable income.  Thus, there 
should be a record of each exemption claimed.  
Tax exemptions usually, but not always, have 
associated tax expenditures.  EXEMPTIONS12    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWE ARE REQUIRED  to assess 
whether the tax provisions 
reviewed are necessary to promote 
or preserve tax equity or efficiency.  
The law, however, does not define 
these terms.  Rather, our analysis 
is based upon criteria developed 
by the U.S. Joint Committee on 
Taxation and the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office, as detailed 
in the Association of International 
Certified Professional Accountants 
publication Guiding Principles of 
Good Tax Policy: A framework for 
evaluating tax proposals . 
According to that framework, tax 
efficiency  is the principle that a tax 
system should not unduly impede 
or reduce the productive capacity 
of the economy.  Tax equity  is the 
principle of taxing taxpayers fairly, 
which means, among other things, 
that similar taxpayers be taxed 
similarly while taxpayers with the 
greatest ability to pay have the 
highest tax burdens.  The concept 
of horizontal equity provides that 
two taxpayers with equal abilities 
to pay should pay the same 
amount of tax, while the concept 
of vertical equity provides that a 
person with the greater payment 
ability pay more.Under the concept of efficiency, 
a tax system should avoid 
hindering economic goals, such 
as economic growth, capital 
formation, and competitiveness 
with other jurisdictions.  A separate, 
but related, concept states that 
administrative and compliance 
costs should be kept low to foster 
effective tax administration.  
However, a tax provision meant 
to improve tax efficiency for one 
group of taxpayers can result in 
less equitable treatment of other 
taxpayers.  For example, an 
exemption designed to increase 
economic activity in a certain 
industry or geographic area will 
reduce tax equity by providing 
favorable tax treatment to these 
activities.  Therefore, lawmakers 
must carefully balance both 
principles to optimize tax policy. 
Section 23-71, HRS, requires 
the Auditor to determine not only 
whether reviewed tax provisions 
promote tax equity or efficiency, but 
also whether they are “necessary 
to promote or preserve tax equity or 
efficiency.”  That mandate implies 
a need to consider each provision 
within Hawai‘i’s current social, 
economic, and budgetary contexts.Tax Equity and Efficiency: Finding the Balance
The concept of  
horizontal equity  
provides that two  
taxpayers with equal  
abilities to pay should pay  
the same amount of tax.
In contrast, vertical equity  
provides that a person with  
the greater ability to pay  
should pay more tax.

IN 2022,  there were 935 claims for all exemptions 
reviewed in this report.  Taxpayers claimed 
$3,726,755,969 in exemptions that we reviewed, 
resulting in, according to our calculations, 
$100,917,175 in tax expenditure.  Overall, 29,080 
taxpayers representing 12.1 percent of the total 
number of GET and Use Tax filers claimed 33,290 
GET exemptions, totaling $32.6 billion, in 2022.
As DOTAX explains in its 2022 Hawai‘i General 
Excise and Use Tax Exemptions report, tax 
expenditures “are the implied revenue cost of the  
deviation from applying the excise and use tax on 
all consumers in Hawaii without any exemptions.”  
The report lists exemptions that DOTAX 
categorizes as tax expenditures at wholesale 
and retail rates (0.5 percent and 4.0 percent, 
respectively), and lists exemptions that DOTAX 
does not consider to be tax expenditures, but 
which may represent forgone opportunities to shift 
tax burdens to non-residents.  
There are also certain exemptions that DOTAX 
does not consider to be “tax expenditures” 
and for which it therefore does not include tax 
expenditure amounts in its report.  For example, 
there are GET exemptions for worker wages, 
stock and bond sales, bad debts, and fee simple 
land sales.  These items, DOTAX states, are 
not traditionally included in the base of a sales 
or excise tax.  They are not properly part of a 
broad-based tax on consumption and would not 
be subject to a sales or excise tax.  Thus, as per 
DOTAX, no actual tax is forgone, meaning there is 
no associated tax expenditure.
DOTAX acknowledges that the assumptions 
underlying its classification scheme may change.  The estimated tax expenditure stemming from 
exemptions varies significantly depending 
on the method used to calculate it.  DOTAX 
calculates tax expenditure of GET exemptions 
using the GET wholesale rate of 0.5 percent 
for all business-to-business claimants.  The 
implicit assumption is that, were the exemption 
nonexistent, all business-to-business taxpayers 
would pay GET on unexempted income at the 
wholesale rate only.  We question DOTAX’s 
assumption, as at least some claims for these 
exemptions were actually made at the retail 
rate, signaling that the taxpayers consider the 
underlying transactions retail, and not wholesale.  
Whether a taxpayer might recharacterize a 
transaction from retail to wholesale, depending 
on whether a taxpayer is paying tax or exempting 
income, is a matter of conjecture.  Our estimate 
is based on the value of the claims and the actual 
tax rate against which they were claimed and, for 
2022, comes to $100,917,175.  
Another concern is that, as DOTAX’s 2022 Hawai‘i 
General Excise and Use Tax Exemptions report 
notes, tax expenditures do not equate to the true 
amount of revenue realized if the exemption were 
to be repealed:  
The data presented in this report provide only 
the amounts of each exemption claimed and 
should not be relied on as an estimate of the 
amount of revenue that may be realized by 
repealing an exemption.  A revenue impact 
estimate must account for the potential 
substitutional and behavioral effects of 
repealing an exemption.Tax Expenditures: At What “Cost”?14    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Act 160, SLH 2013,  
reassigned the exemption  
from Section 237-24.3(5) to 
Section 237-24.3(4), HRS.What does this exemption do?
This exemption exempts from GET two sets of income related to 
employee benefit plans (Plans).  First, it exempts contributions, 
dividends, interest, and other income received by a Plan.  Second, 
it exempts income received by a nonprofit organization or office as 
payments for costs and expenses incurred for the administration of a 
Plan.  Not exempt are gross rental income and gross rental proceeds 
from investments in real property.  Real property investment income 
remains taxable, even if it signifies one of the two sets of income that 
the provision would otherwise exempt.
A Plan, for purposes of the exemption, includes both employee 
welfare benefit plans and employee pension benefit plans.  An 
employee welfare benefit plan is a plan, fund, or program established 
or maintained by an employer or employee organization for the 
purpose of providing to participants medical, unemployment, 
vacation, apprenticeship, day care, scholarship, and legal services 
benefits.  An employee pension benefit plan is a plan, fund, or 
program established or maintained by an employer or employee 
organization and that defers employee income or otherwise provides 
employee retirement income.
How the Exemption is Claimed
Claimants exempt qualified amounts by reporting the revenue on 
“Schedule GE (Form G-45/G-49),” the General Excise/Use Tax 
Schedule of Exemptions and Deductions (hereafter referred to as 
Schedule GE) submitted with a GET return.  The taxpayer includes 16    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statuteson Part I of Schedule GE all exemptions claimed, reporting the amount 
of each exemption and other information specific to the exemption, 
including an “ED Code,” or exemption/deduction code, that corresponds 
to the law allowing the exemption.  The ED Code for the Employee 
Benefit Plans exemption is 114. 
Neither Schedule GE nor any GET return requires claimants to provide 
proof of or otherwise substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  
However, because revenues associated with income related to employee 
benefit plans must be reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify 
tax expenditure. 
What is the purpose of this exemption?
Neither the 1985 original enactment nor any related committee report 
specifies any particular legislative purpose for exempting benefit plan 
income.  However, the Senate Committee on Labor and Employment 
referenced testimony from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners of America that general excise tax reduces moneys available 
to pay benefits to employees and retirees.  We infer, then, that one 
intended purpose of removing general excise tax is to increase moneys 
available to pay benefits to employees and retirees – noting that, per our 
mandate, the purpose of an incentive may be “reasonably identified by 
the auditor.”
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
How much the removal of general excise tax through this exemption 
in fact increases moneys available to pay benefits to employees and 
retirees is something we cannot determine.  Benefit plans, and not 
necessarily their employees and retirees, are the direct beneficiaries of 
the exemption.  While we know from claims made that benefit plans 
are saving tax dollars, there is no data readily available to indicate or 
prove whether those dollars are passed on to employees and retirees 
or diverted elsewhere.  In other words, we do not know – and cannot 
assume – what benefit plans are doing with their tax savings.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 59, 57, 37, and 33 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this provision 
was $395,321,000, $356,437,000, $501,247,000, and $332,397,000, 
respectively.
When determining the tax expenditure corresponding to this exemption, 
DOTAX appears to treat this incentive as an exclusion.  It assigns no – 
or $0 – tax expenditure to the exemption for every year.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    17
We disagree with the DOTAX treatment of the exemption and its 
corresponding calculation of the associated tax expenditure of $0.  
We believe the exemption does yield an expenditure because, prior 
to the existence of the exemption, the State did, in fact, tax relevant 
income.  The exemption signifies a forgoing of tax revenue and thus an 
expenditure. 
We calculated the amount of revenue that would have been collected 
but for the exemption, in the table below.  As all claims related to 
transactions taxable at the 4 percent rate, which is the rate indicated by 
those claiming the exemption, we multiplied the sum of all claims by 
4 percent to determine the revenue forgone, i.e., the tax expenditure 
associated with the exemption.

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is no readily available data correlating, in any way, claims to 
exempt benefit plan income and economic or employment benefits to 
Hawai‘i.  
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for benefit plan income be 
retained.  We see no reason to modify the exemption, and repeal would 
lead to the imposition of a tax known to reduce benefit plan moneys 
available to employees and retirees.  Retaining the exemption will 
ensure that it continue to meet its purpose of preventing the reduction of 
such moneys.

Legislative History
1985
Congress passed the Food 
Security Act of 1985, which 
prohibited states that impose 
a sales tax on food stamp 
purchases from participating 
in the federal food stamp 
program.  It was effective 
after the end of each state’s 
next legislative session, 
affording each state time to 
modify its laws, if needed.
1986
Act 86, SLH 1986, enacted 
the exemption for food 
stamp purchases, codified as 
Section 237-24(23), HRS, but 
with a proviso.  The proviso 
was that the exemption 
would apply only if the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture 
determined that the 
application of Hawai‘i’s GET 
to food stamp purchases 
would disqualify Hawai‘i from 
participating in the Food 
Stamp Program, under the 
Food Security Act of 1985.
Congress passed the School 
Lunch and Child Nutrition 
Amendments of 1986, 
prohibiting states that impose 
a sales tax on purchases 
made under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC)7 from 
participating in that program.
1987
Act 15, SLH 1987,  
removed the proviso from 
Section 237-24(23), HRS, exempting all federal food 
coupons unconditionally.  
Act 15 also expanded 
the exemption to exempt 
amounts received for 
purchases made with food 
vouchers under WIC.
Act 39, SLH 1987, 
reassigned the exemption 
from subsection (23) to 
subsection (22) of  
Section 237-24, HRS.
1993
Act 220, SLH 1993, 
reassigned the exemption 
from Section 237-24(22) to 
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS.
2013
Act 160, SLH 2013, 
reassigned the exemption 
from Section 237-24.3(6) to 
Section 237-24.3(5), HRS.

7 The Child Nutrition Amendments of 1986, as well as Act 15, SLH 1987, and  
Section 237-24.3(5), HRS, all use “Food” or “Foods” in place of “Nutrition” in the full 
program name for WIC.  However, the Hawai’i Department of Health uses “Nutrition” in 
the program name.  In this report, we use “Nutrition” in the program name to align with 
other current government publications and to reflect the fact that WIC covers not only food 
products, but also nutrition counseling, screening, and health services referrals.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    19
What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET all revenues from purchases using 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food coupons under the 
Food Stamp Program or with USDA food vouchers under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children 
(WIC).  It states that Chapter 237, HRS – which relates to GET – 
does not apply to purchases made with food stamps or with WIC 
vouchers.  
The Food Stamp Program, officially known as the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), is a federal program that 
provides food and nutritional support to qualifying low-income and 
needy households.  It is funded through the USDA and administered 
at both the federal and state levels.  In Hawai‘i, the Department of 
Human Services (DHS) administers the program.
WIC is also a federally funded program that provides supplemental 
foods, nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion, and health 
and social service referrals to qualifying low-income and pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or postpartum women, and persons under age five 
who are at medical or nutritional risk.  The USDA administers the 
program at the federal level, and the Hawai‘i Department of Health 
(DOH) administers it at the state level.
How the Exemption is Claimed
Businesses that receive food stamps and WIC food vouchers report 
the corresponding revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/
Deductions (ED) Code 119, “Food Stamps and WIC (§237-24.3(5)).”  
The revenues are thus reported and are subtracted from the 
businesses’ total revenues on the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49, 
resulting in no GET liability on those revenues.  We note that even 
though the exemption applies to separate federal food assistance 
programs – one for food stamps and one for WIC food vouchers –  
it evolved as, and continues to be reported as, a single exemption.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise 
substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because 
revenues associated with food stamps and WIC food vouchers must 
be reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What are the purposes of this exemption?
The Food Security Act of 1985 prohibits states participating in 
the Food Stamp Program from imposing sales tax on food stamp 
receipts.  Enacting the exemption allowed Hawai‘i to continue to 
participate in the program.20    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesThe School Lunch and Child Nutrition Amendments of 1986 prohibit 
states participating in the WIC program from imposing sales tax on 
WIC receipts.  Enacting the exemption allowed Hawai‘i to continue to 
participate in the program.
Is the exemption meeting its purposes?
Allowing continued participation in both the food stamp and WIC 
programs, the exemption is achieving its purposes as intended.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption in 2019-2021?
DOTAX reports 411, 392, 383, and 390 GET filings claiming the 
exemption in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of 
those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under 
this exemption was $366,558,000, $499,320,000, $830,302,000, and 
$1,016,107,000, respectively.
We and DOTAX agree that the tax expenditure for all four years should 
be zero, but we agree for different reasons.  DOTAX reasons that 
purchases made with food stamps and WIC vouchers would not be 
subject to a sales, excise, or other form of consumption tax, even absent 
an exemption, because the federal government does not permit such 
taxation of such items.  That is, the State would collect $0 even without 
the exemption, because it would not be allowed to tax the underlying 
items.  While we agree with the ultimate outcome, we note that the 
relevant federal law – the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended – does 
not directly prohibit taxation; instead, it prohibits participation in the 
food stamp program for any state that does tax food stamp purchases.  
If it so wished, Hawai‘i could, legally, impose GET law on revenue 
relating to food stamp and WIC program-related purchases.  However, 
taxing the receipts would mean non-participation in the programs, which 
would mean no more receipts, which would mean $0 tax.

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, do the benefits outweigh the costs of this exemption?
The primary benefit of this exemption is the continued ability of the 
State to participate in the Food Stamp Program and WIC.  It is in part 
because of the exemption that the State receives federal funds to feed 
and safeguard the health of low-income residents in need.  Given that 
the tax expenditure is $0, and assuming that the Legislature and State 
generally view welfare positively, the impact to Hawai‘i residents 
should be purely beneficial.
Should this exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for food stamp and WIC 
voucher purchases be retained without modification.  Maintaining the 
nontaxability of such purchases is necessary to continuing Hawai‘i 
participation in the Food Stamp and WIC programs.  As stated by the 
Senate Committee on Human Services, loss of participation would 
have a significant negative impact on the public health of the people of 
Hawai‘i.22    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET the revenue from certain  
sales of prescription drugs and prosthetic devices.  It states that  
Chapter 237, HRS – which relates to GET – does not apply to the 
qualified sales.  To qualify for the exemption, the sale must be by 
a hospital, infirmary, medical clinic, health care facility, pharmacy, 
or, in the case of a drug sale, a pharmacist or practitioner licensed to 
administer the drug.  The sale must also be to an individual.  Services 
sold in connection with the sale of any drug or prosthetic device do 
not qualify the exemption. 
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS, defines “prescription drugs” to include 
only those drugs whose introduction or delivery into interstate 
commerce has been approved by the U.S. Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, and sold by licensed pharmacists or practitioners 
licensed to administer them.  Statutorily excluded from prescription 
drugs covered by the exemption are cannabis and manufactured 
cannabis products.
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS, defines “prosthetic device” to include 
any artificial device used to replace a missing or removed part of 
the human body, so long as the device is prescribed by a licensed 
practitioner of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatry and sold by 
that practitioner or a dealer of such devices.  Also included are 
components of, and accessories to, such device.  Notably excluded, 
for exemption purposes, are all auditory, ophthalmic, dental, and 
ocular devices.General Excise Tax Exemption for Prescriptions and

We note that while the sales of the tangible drugs and devices 
themselves are exempt, this exemption does not apply to any services 
rendered in connection with such sales.  Income from such services 
remain subject to GET. 
How the Exemption is Claimed
A seller of prescription drugs and prosthetic devices reports 
corresponding revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions 
(ED) Code 113, “Drugs and Prosthetic Devices  (§237-24.3( 6)).”  
Although the revenues relating to the sale of prescription drugs are 
reported together with those from the sale of prosthetic devices, the 
combined revenues are subtracted from the business’s total revenues on 
the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49.  No GET should be owed on the 
relevant revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise substantiate 
the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because revenues 
associated with prescription drugs and prosthetic devices must be 
reported on Schedule GE, data exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What are the purposes of this exemption?
The exemption for prescription drugs and prosthetic devices was 
part of a package of GET exemptions aimed at encouraging business 
expansion.  According to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, 
the exemptions would increase revenues to the State through business 
activity and lower the pyramiding tendences of GET, ultimately 
reducing costs to final purchasers.  With respect to prescription drugs 
and prosthetics, a more specific goal was to assist lower income and 
elderly populations.  The committee believed that the exemption would 
be of particular assistance to the chronically ill and alleviate the high 
cost of living in Hawai‘i. 
Is the exemption meeting its purposes?
Regarding the purpose of encouraging business expansion, there is 
insufficient readily available data to draw a causal link between the tax 
exemption and any related business expansion in the State.  
Regarding the purpose of reducing costs to final purchasers and 
alleviating the high cost of living in Hawai‘i, the exemption should 
be having an effect exactly equal to the amount of tax that, absent 
the exemption, would be passed on to consumers.  As detailed in the 
economic impact paragraphs below, prices for prescription drugs have 
risen more than twice as fast as household income, such that any tax 
savings should have also risen.  24    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

exemption in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of 
those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this 
provision was $2.07, $1.82 billion, $1.98 billion, and 1.84 billion, 
respectively.

The expenditures calculated by DOTAX appear to imply that DOTAX 
treats all claims for this exemption as related to retail transactions only. 
The rate applicable to retail transactions is 4 percent, and the DOTAX 
expenditure values (apart from rounding to the nearest $1,000) are 
exactly 4 percent of corresponding claim totals.  Our office agrees 
with the DOTAX approach insofar as the exemption applies to sales 
to individuals only and individual buyers are likely not reselling 
prescription drugs or prosthetics.  We note, however, that some 
taxpayers in fact claimed the exemption under the wholesale rate.  As 
our office is not at liberty to recharacterize the nature of a transaction 
as reported by a taxpayer, we calculated expenditure by using a mix of 
retail and wholesale rate claims.  For each year, we multiplied 4 percent 
by the retail claim amount and 0.5 percent by the wholesale claim 
amount, and summed the two arithmetic products. 
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, do the benefits outweigh the costs of this exemption?
As discussed above, there should be a benefit to those consumers to 
the extent tax savings are passed to end consumers.  Drug prices have 
risen, such that the tax benefit should, in turn, have grown.  During the 
five-year period of 2015 through 2019, the annual cost of prescription 
drug treatment increased by 26.3 percent in Hawai‘i, while the annual 
10 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    25
average income for State residents grew by only 10.5 percent.  During 
the six-year period of 2012 through 2017, the most prescribed drug in 
Hawai‘i, atorvastatin (better known by its generic name Lipitor), saw 
its price rise by 137 percent.  As of 2021, inflation in the U.S. average 
price of Lipitor surpassed the global median of national averages by 
approximately 2,200 percent, making Lipitor the drug with the third-
highest U.S. inflation rate relative to the rest of the world.  
Despite the rise in drug prices and corresponding increase in tax 
savings, the ultimate value of the benefit remains relatively low 
inasmuch as Hawai‘i – despite high prices – boasts the lowest per capita 
out-of-pocket expenditure on prescription drugs.  On average, a Hawai‘i 
resident spends only $82.08 per year on prescription drugs. 
Should this exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the GET exemption for prescription drugs and 
prosthetic devices be retained without modification.  While low out-
of-pocket costs appear caused more by insurance coverage and low 
incidence rates than by any tax exemption, retaining the exemption 
should help maintain the low-cost status quo.  Repealing the exemption, 
by contrast, could cause a rise in prices, and given the purpose of 
reducing costs to final purchasers and alleviating the high cost of living 
in Hawai‘i, we see no reason for any statutory modification. 26    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET the dues received by an 
unincorporated merchants association from its members to promote 
and advertise the association for the benefit of all its members as a 
whole.  More specifically, the exemption applies to dues received for 
“advertising media, promotional, and advertising costs,” including 
dues received as reimbursements of those costs.  The advertising and 
promotional costs must also be for the benefit of all members of the 
association.  The exemption specifically disqualifies costs to benefit 
a particular member or group of members comprising less than the 
whole.  Dues that the merchants association uses for other purposes, 
including to cover other association-related costs, are not exempt 
from GET under this provision.  
How the Exemption is Claimed
A merchants association receiving dues to cover qualified advertising 
and promotional costs reports the revenues on Schedule GE, under 
Exemptions/Deductions (ED) Code 129, “Merchants’ Association 
Dues (§237-24.3(8)).”  Although the dues revenues are reported, they 
are subtracted from the association’s gross income on the periodic 
G-45 and the annual G-49.  No GET should be owed on the relevant 
revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise 
substantiate the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because 
revenues from association dues must be reported on Schedule GE, 
data exists to quantify tax expenditure.General Excise Tax Exemption for Merchants Association

11 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    27
What is the purpose of this exemption?
This exemption was enacted to ensure that dues to cover promotional 
and advertising costs be exempt from GET.  It is a general principle 
that, in the context of an association, corporation, or legal person 
that has members or shareholders, the reimbursement of costs or 
advances made for or on behalf of one person by another should 
not be taxable.  Consistent with that principle, in 1968, DOTAX 
advised the Ala Moana Center Association that such dues were non-
taxable reimbursements.  In 1973, DOTAX advised the Pearlridge 
Center Association the same.  In 1979, however, DOTAX issued 
Tax Information Release (TIR) 67-79, which superseded the earlier 
opinions and asserted such dues were subject to GET.  This exemption, 
enacted in 1986, overruled that TIR, reasserting that such dues are to 
be exempt.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Yes, the exemption is meeting its purpose of ensuring that merchant 
association dues to cover promotional and advertising costs remain 
exempt from GET.  Whether the exemption is redundant in light 
of a possible preexisting exclusion, as discussed in the expenditure 
paragraphs below, does not affect the fact that the exemption, by its 
operation, furthers its intended purpose.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 30, 24, 9, and 8 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $17,864,000, $12,696,000, $7,569,000, and $6,864,000, 
respectively.
When determining the tax expenditure corresponding to this 
exemption, DOTAX appears to treat all the underlying transactions 
as wholesale transactions and calculates the amount of the tax 
expenditure using the wholesale GET rate.  That is, DOTAX assumes 
that, were the association dues subject to GET, the association would 
pay the wholesale rate of 0.5 percent on the membership dues – 
eightfold lower than the 4 percent rate applicable to retail transactions.  
By contrast, we calculate the amount of the tax expenditure (i.e., the 
loss of tax revenue to the State) based on the tax rate that taxpayers 
actually reported when claiming the exemption, and over 99 percent of 
claims reflected the 4 percent retail rate.  Hence, our tax expenditure 
values are roughly eight times those of DOTAX.28    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is no readily available data demonstrating any causal relationship 
between this exemption and employment or economic statistics.  
However, the effect of the exemption is to prevent GET imposition 
upon dues that, immediately prior to the exemption, were taxable.  
Consequently, there is an economic benefit in the form of GET savings 
to the merchants associations.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend retention of this exemption.  It is meeting its purpose of 
ensuring that association dues intended to cover association advertising 
remain untaxed by GET, overruling a Tax Information Release with 
which the Legislature disagreed.  While at first glance the exemption 
might appear superfluous in light of the principle that an association’ s 
cost reimbursements by its members be GET-free, the TIR triggered the 
need for the exemption to achieve that goal.

What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET income received by a labor 
organization from leasing real property to another labor organization 
or to a trust fund established by a labor organization for the benefit of 
its members and their families and dependents.  The claimant labor 
organization  must be qualified as an Internal Revenue Code Section 
501(c)(5) non-profit organization.  Among other things, that means the 
organization’s earnings must not inure to the benefit of any particular 
member, and its goals must be the betterment of the conditions of 
those engaged in labor, agriculture, or horticulture, the improvement of 
the grade of related products, and improved efficiency in those fields.
How the Exemption is Claimed
A labor organization reports its qualified rental income on  
Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions (ED) Code 125, “Labor

this particular exemption for labor organizations.30    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised StatutesWhat is the purpose of this exemption?
The purpose of this exemption is to counteract a U.S. Supreme Court 
case that affected labor organizations’ funding – to promote the 
activities of, and allow flexibility in the operations of, organized labor.  
In Communications Workers v. Beck , 487 U.S. 735 (1988), the U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that trade unions could not collect dues for any 
purpose other than collective bargaining.  Consequently, unions saw 
their collections curtailed and testified in support of tax relief.  This 
exemption is an example of relief extended to the unions.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Given that the purpose of this exemption is to promote organized labor 
generally, it would appear to be meeting its purpose.  Ultimately, the 
tax exemption resulted in less tax due from labor organizations.  Lower 
taxes for the organizations should facilitate the continuing of such 
organizations’ activities, functions, and operational flexibility.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 22, 23, 13, and 15 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $47,295,000, $47,535,000, $282,000, and $298,000, respectively.  
Our figures coincide roughly with those of DOTAX, as both we and 
DOTAX applied the 4 percent retail rate to all transactions.  All claims 
for this exemption were made at the retail rate.

if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
While we lack data showing any causal relationship between claims 
for this exemption and any economic or employment impact on the 
Hawai‘i economy, we suspect that the exemption has negligible or no 
impact on the State due to the low amount claimed.  As of 2021, the 
amount claimed was only $282,000, signifying about $11,000 in State 
expenditure – or a cost of $0.02 per low-income resident.
Should the exemption be retained without modification,

We recommend retaining this exemption.  The provision meets its 
purpose of promoting the activities and functions of organized labor, 
by exempting lease revenues and thereby increasing funds available to

16 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET amounts received by the operator 
of the Hawai‘i Convention Center for reimbursements of costs or 
advances made pursuant to a contract with the Hawai‘i Tourism 
Authority (HTA).  It applies only to the entity contracted by HTA to 
operate the Hawai‘i Convention Center, meaning no other taxpayer 
is able to exempt revenue under this provision, including entities 
receiving reimbursements under contracts with HTA .  It also applies 
to payments only from HTA, meaning the convention center operator 
cannot exempt from GET any reimbursements it might receive from 
private persons or other governmental bodies.
How the Exemption is Claimed
The operator of the Hawai‘i Convention Center reports revenues that 
it intends to exempt on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions 
(ED) Code 121, “Hawaii Convention Center Operator.”  The revenues 
are thus reported, but are subtracted out – via Schedule GE and the 
periodic G-45 – prior to calculating the amount of revenue subject to 
GET.  No GET should be owed on the exempted revenues.
What is the purpose of this exemption?
The purpose of this exemption is to ensure that payments from HTA to 
the Hawai‘i Convention Center operator are not reduced by GET.  HTA 
contracts with the operator, to whom the HTA reimburses the costs of 
operating and marketing the center.  The payments are not payments 
for services, but are reimbursements mandated by rules of the special 
fund through which the moneys flow.  If those amounts were subject to General Excise Tax Exemption for the Hawai‘i Convention

GET, then the operator – by having to pay tax – would have fewer funds 
than designated for operating and marketing the facility.  Eliminating 
the tax ensures that no such reduction in funds occur.
That last point could best be illustrated by a few numbers mentioned 
explicitly by the Legislature in the Act establishing the exemption.  At 
the time of enactment, the operator had received $16 million in cost 
advances and reimbursements, upon which DOTAX sought to impose 
a $700,000 tax.  The Legislature indicated that the $700,000, going 
toward GET, could not be used by the operator to cover expenses.  
Indeed, the operator would not even be able to cover the tax with its true 
compensation, which was only $500,000, presumably meaning that the 
operator would have to use at least some of its reimbursement moneys 
to pay tax.  In short, the exemption was enacted to ensure that the 
special fund function as it was legally required to work – that moneys 
from the fund be used only to cover convention center operational 
expenses, and not to pay tax.
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
Yes, the exemption is meeting its purpose.  It allows all reimbursement 
moneys paid from HTA to be used to cover expenses for which they 
were issued.  
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
This exemption is for the convention center operator only, such that, 
for any year in which there is only one operator, there should be only 
one claim of this exemption.  Indeed, for 2021 and 2020, DOTAX 
suppressed disclosure of data relating to this exemption because there 
were fewer than 5 claimants.  It is DOTAX policy to withhold the 
number of taxpayers claiming an incentive when that number is five 
or fewer.  That is to prevent readers from being able to identify any 
particular taxpayer and thus protect confidential taxpayer information.
With regard to tax year 2019, our expenditure differs from that of 
DOTAX because we apply the 4 percent retail rate of tax, while 
DOTAX applies the 0.5 percent wholesale rate.  As detailed previously 
in this report, we disagree with the approach that business-to-business 
transactions ought to be characterized as wholesale transactions 
regardless of how taxpayers, themselves, characterized their own 
transactions.  To apply one rate when a taxpayer has identified another 
as applicable is tantamount to recharacterizing the transaction, and while 
DOTAX in its enforcement capacity may be authorized to take such 
action, we are not. 34    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024

Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
We lack the data necessary to determine whether this exemption has any 
economic impact upon the State.  Without amounts claimed, numbers 
of claimants, or expenditure values, and no performance benchmarks 
or other metrics identified in Section 237-24.75(2), HRS, we cannot 
conduct a cost-benefit analysis, estimate any direct employment impact, 
or otherwise calculate the economic effects of the exemption.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the Hawai‘i Convention Center operator GET 
exemption enacted at Section 237-24.75(2), HRS, be retained.  
At least one taxpayer – and presumably only one taxpayer, the 
Convention Center Operator – is claiming the exemption, which means 
reimbursements from the HTA are not being reduced by any need to 
pay GET.  Keeping such reimbursements free from reduction by tax, the 
exemption is meeting its legislative purpose.

What does this exemption do?
This provision exempts from GET revenue received by professional 
employer organizations, registered with the Hawai‘i Department of 
Labor and Industrial Relations, from their client companies for wage 
reimbursements and other compensation reimbursements.  Removing 
such revenues from GET effectively prevents double-taxation, as 
without the exemption the client companies would owe GET on their General Excise Tax Exemption for Wage and Fringe Benefit 
Reimbursements to Professional Employer Organizations

Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesincome and employer organizations would owe GET on the same dollars 
passed to them to cover wages.  The elimination of double taxation is 
further explored in our section on this exemption’s purpose, below.
A professional employer organization, for purposes of the exemption, 
means an organization that contracts with client companies to provide 
that company with long-term employees, and specifically excludes 
companies providing temporary help services or similar short-term 
employment services.  Only those amounts received by the professional 
employer organization from a client company that were disbursed by the 
professional employer organization to cover employee wages, salaries, 
payroll taxes, insurance premiums, and benefits such as retirement, 
vacation, and sick pay are exempt from GET.  The exemption does 
not apply if the professional employer organization has not fulfilled or 
maintained registration requirements or failed to pay any withholding 
taxes with respect to the covered employees.
How the Exemption is Claimed
A professional employer organization reports wage reimbursement 
revenues on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/Deductions (ED)  
Code 137, “Professional Employer Organizations  (§237-24.75(3)) .”  
Although relevant revenues are reported, they are subtracted from the 
business’s total revenues on the periodic G-45 and the annual G-49.   
No GET should be owed on the relevant revenues.
Claimants are not required to provide proof of or otherwise substantiate 
the exemptions on their GET filings.  However, because revenues 
associated with the exemption must be reported on Schedule GE, data 
exists to quantify tax expenditure.
What is the purpose of this exemption?
This exemption was part of a larger package of provisions – Act 225,  
SLH 2007 – whose collective purpose was to make outsourcing of 
employment and payroll more cost-effective for Hawai‘i’s small 
business owners, while protecting employee rights.  The particular 
cost savings embodied by the GET exemption is the elimination of 
double taxation.  Without the exemption, there would be two levels 
of general excise taxation on the same income, as follows: first, GET  
would apply to revenues recognized by the employer client of the 
professional employer organization, from whatever services or products 
the client sells; second, GET would apply to revenues recognized by the 
professional employer organization itself, from its selling hiring services 
to the client – and including any wage reimbursements.  The provision 
exempts the wage reimbursements, thus eliminating double taxation to 
the extent of those amounts.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    37
Is the exemption meeting its purpose?
The direct beneficiaries of the exemption are the professional employer 
organizations receiving reimbursements for the wages paid to employees 
assigned to clients.  Indirectly, clients of such organizations benefit to 
the extent GET is not passed on to them.  Ultimately, the benefit to the 
client means that the exemption appears to be achieving its purposes.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for this exemption from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 42, 43, 52, and 63 GET filings claiming the exemption 
in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each of those years, 
the total amount of revenue that was exempted under this exemption 
was $72,433,000, $181,867,000, $183,366,000, and $251,451,000 
respectively.  Over 99 percent of claims for this exemption were made at 
the retail rate, a fact for which our expenditure calculation accounts.

Note that the DOTAX expenditure value with respect to this exemption, 
for each of the last four years, is $0.  This implies that DOTAX 
considers the incentive to be an exclusion, as opposed to exemption – 
meaning no GET was intended to apply or would be collected even were 
the exemption repealed.  We disagree with that understanding of the tax 
incentive, as prior to the exemption the relevant reimbursements were, 
in fact, taxed.  The Legislature enacted the exemption specifically to 
carve out the reimbursements from taxable income, and thereby prevent 
double taxation, as previously discussed.
We are aware of a separate, statutory exclusionary rule applicable to 
reimbursements, but we believe such rule should not apply with respect 
to the specific category of income covered by this exemption.  Codified 
19 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.38    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutesat Section 237-20, HRS, is a general principle that reimbursements 
of costs or advances made for or on behalf of another shall not 
constitute gross income of that person – meaning such income will 
be excluded and not reportable.  However, that rule is tempered by 
two limitations, both of which should prevent it from applying to the 
revenues covered by this incentive.  First, the Section 237-20 principle 
appears in the context of companies or other legal persons receiving 
reimbursements from their constituents – such as a corporation 
reimbursed by its own shareholders or an association reimbursed by 
its members.  Here, the income is not flowing from a constituent to 
a whole, but from a purchaser of services to an entirely unrelated 
seller.  Second, the principle, by its own language later in the statute, 
does not apply when the person receiving the reimbursement also 
receives additional monetary consideration for covering the relevant 
costs or advances.  Here, the professional employer organization, in 
addition to receiving reimbursements, is paid an additional amount for 
its services, which include the payment of employee compensation.  
Ultimately, the exclusionary rule for reimbursements should not apply 
to reimbursements to professional employer organizations from those 
organizations’ clients.
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemption?
There is insufficient data readily available to draw any conclusion as to 
whether this exemption has been the cause of any economic activity, or 
lack thereof, in the State.
Should the exemption be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We recommend that the exemption for professional employer 
organizations be retained.  It appears to be meeting its intended purpose 
without any significant adverse effect.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    39

Act 78, SLH 1986, in which the Legislature 
asserted that there were certain areas in the State 
needing particular attention of government to help 
attract private-sector investment.  These areas, or 
“Enterprise Zones,” are meant to be major economic 
development tools to help bring business and 
employment opportunities to otherwise economically challenged areas.  Eligible businesses located 
within an Enterprise Zone and that meet hiring 
requirements are exempt from GET and may claim 
personal or corporate non-refundable income tax 
and state unemployment premium credits, among 
other benefits.  Counties can also offer additional 
incentives, such as incremental property tax relief, 
priority permit processing, or fee waivers.

What does this exemption provision do?
This provision exempts from GET the revenue from activities in an 
Enterprise Zone by two distinct types of business: a business qualified 
by the Hawai‘i Department of Business, Economic Development and 
Tourism (DBEDT) as an Enterprise Zone business and a licensed 
construction contractor. 
Enterprise Zone Businesses
The first of the two exemptions in Section 209E-11, HRS, applies 
to businesses operating within an Enterprise Zone.  The law allows 
qualified businesses in an Enterprise Zone not to have to pay GET  
on proceeds from eligible business activities undertaken in the 
same county as that zone.  What businesses qualify, and which 
activities are eligible, are identified by other sections of the HRS 
Chapter on Enterprise Zones, as follows.
A business is a “qualified business” for exemption purposes if it is 
so authorized by DBEDT, which requires that the business engage 
in eligible business activity in an Enterprise Zone, attribute at least 
50 percent of its gross receipts to operations within Enterprise 
Zones in the same county, and meet one of two additional growth 
requirements, depending on whether it is an agricultural or non-
agricultural business.  The additional growth requirement for an 
agricultural business is a rise of at least two percent in gross sales 
of agricultural products produced or processed within Enterprise 
Zones in the same county as the Enterprise Zone of operations.  
The additional growth requirement for a non-agricultural business 
is a rise of at least ten percent in average number of full-time 
employees over the first year within Enterprise Zones in the same 
county as the Enterprise Zone in which the business primarily 
operates.  The business must also maintain the new, heightened 
level of employment, during each successive year.  In the case 
of any business selling physical goods or services, the items sold 
must also be sold within an Enterprise Zone – and, in the case of 
goods, that Enterprise Zone and the Enterprise Zone in which title 
transfers must all be within the same county.  Finally, to remain 
qualified year after year, any qualified business must submit and 
have approved by DBEDT annual applications for recertification.
Eligible business activity is defined by an exhaustive list of 
qualifying activities.  Eligible activities are prescriptively limited to:
•	The manufacture or wholesale sale of tangible personal 
property;
•	Services in the repair of ships, aircraft, or assisted technology 
equipment, or in the fields of telecommunications, 
information technology design and production, medicine, 
healthcare, education, or training;42    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024
Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes•	Genetically-engineered medical, agricultural, or maritime 
biotechnology product research, development, sale, or 
production;
•	Wind energy production for sale to a public utility; and
•	Agricultural production or processing within an enterprise 
zone, except that retail sales of non-genetically-engineered 
agricultural products are not exempt.
Statutorily excluded are any activities of a medical cannabis 
dispensary, regardless of whether such activities would otherwise 
qualify.
The exemption can be claimed for up to seven years only or, 
in the case of manufacturing or the producing or processing of 
agricultural products, for up to ten years.
Enterprise Zone Construction Contractors
The second of the exemptions in Section 209E-11, HRS, is for 
income from Enterprise Zone construction within an Enterprise 
Zone.  Income received by a contractor for construction work is 
exempt from GET, provided that the contractor is Hawai‘i-licensed 
and the work is performed in an Enterprise Zone for an Enterprise 
Zone qualified business.
How the Exemptions are Claimed
With respect to claims by qualified businesses, taxpayers report 
revenues that they intend to exempt on Schedule GE, under Exemptions/
Deductions (ED) Code 115, “Enterprise Zones (§209E-11).”  The 
revenues are thus reported, but are subtracted out – via Schedule GE and 
the periodic G-45 – prior to calculating the amount of GET owed.  No 
GET should be owed on the relevant revenues.
With respect to claims by construction contractors serving qualified 
businesses, taxpayers report in precisely the same way, but under 
ED Code 107, “Contracting Activity in an Enterprise Zone ( §209E-
11).”   The two exemptions – one for qualified businesses and one for 
construction contractors – are tracked separately by DOTAX.
What is the purpose of these exemptions?
The purpose of the Enterprise Zone program was to stimulate business 
and industrial growth in areas where such would result in neighborhood 
revitalization.  Such growth was to be accomplished by regulatory 
flexibility and tax incentives, with these exemptions as incentives 
provided under the program.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    43
Are the exemptions meeting their purpose?
We cannot determine from data available whether either GET exemption 
is meeting its purpose.  DBEDT annually publishes a report evaluating 
the effectiveness of the Enterprise Zone program and providing related 
recommendations to the Governor, but it is unclear from the DBEDT 
reports how much, if at all, the GET exemption stimulated business and 
industrial growth in areas needing revitalization.  In 2022, DBEDT-
certified Enterprise Zone companies reported 855 new or maintained 
jobs statewide, signifying a decline from the 1,113 reported in 2021.  
DBEDT attributed much of the decline to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and the report does not evaluate the extent to which jobs created 
and maintained impacted the economic vitality of their surrounding 
Enterprise Zone.  Secondly, there is no way to segregate any impact 
caused by the GET exemption under Section 209E-11 from any 
impact caused by the rest of the Enterprise Zone program – notably 
the Enterprise Zone income tax credit allowed under Section 209E-10, 
HRS.  There are also no benchmarks or performance targets for the 
Enterprise Zone exemption established in Section 209E-11.
What were the number of claimants, total amount claimed, 
and tax expenditures for these exemptions from 2019-2022?
DOTAX reports 192, 187, 169, and 149 GET filings claiming the 
exemptions in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.  For each 
of those years, the total amount of revenue that was exempted under 
the exemptions was $476,140,000, $471,695,000, $440,397,000, 
and $254,851,000, respectively.  Over 88 percent of claims for the 
exemptions were made at the wholesale rate, for which our expenditure

We note that DOTAX appears to calculate the expenditure for ED 115, 
pertaining to qualified businesses, differently from how it calculates 
that for ED 107, pertaining to contractors.  With respect to qualified 
businesses claiming the exemption for operating in an Enterprise Zone, 
DOTAX uses the retail rate only – for all such claimants.  Implicit in 
the use of the retail rate is an assumption that all such businesses are 
selling to end consumers only.  With respect to construction contractors, 
by contrast, DOTAX appears to assume that all contractors are selling 
to buyers who are not end consumers.  It applies the wholesale rate to 
expenditure calculations with respect to contractors. 
21 The Office of the Auditor performed some calculations by itself, using DOTAX data.    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024    45
Is there an economic or employment benefit to Hawai‘i, and 
if so, does the benefit outweigh the cost of the exemptions?
The DBEDT annual Enterprise Zone report from 2022 shows that 
Enterprise Zone companies claiming the exemptions have created or 
maintained jobs, but we cannot determine to what extent there is or is 
not a causal connection between such job creation and the exemptions.  
According to the report, Enterprise Zone companies reported creating or 
maintaining 1,113 jobs in 2021.  Forgone revenue from Enterprise Zone 
GET exemptions for the same year totaled $4,442,913.  Hence, even 
excluding the expenditure of any Enterprise Zone income tax credits, 
the GET exemptions cost the State $3,992 per job.  Based on DOTAX 
expenditure values above, the cost per job rises to $15,062.  Factoring in 
Enterprise Zone income tax expenditures would only raise the cost per 
job further.  DBEDT has stated the cost per job of the income tax credit 
and a related GET exemption, combined, has been fairly consistent 
in past years, never exceeding $2,500.  However, DBEDT assumes 
the wholesale rate for all related transactions and does not factor in 
construction contractor claims under exemption/deduction code 107.  
Should the exemptions be retained without modification, 
amended, or repealed?
We lack sufficient adequately reliable data and analysis to determine 
whether the tax credit should be retained, substantively amended, 
or repealed.  The ultimate goal of the exemption is to revitalize 
neighborhoods, a goal we understand to imply job growth and job 
maintenance.  While the rate of job growth in Enterprise Zones has 
decreased, DBEDT attributes that decline to COVID-19 – and jobs 
have consistently grown or been maintained.  Unfortunately, we cannot 
determine to what extent the decrease may be due to an exemption 
or another cause.  Additionally, the Legislature did not include 
performance criteria for measuring achievement of the purpose of 
the exemptions.  Ultimately, to what extent the exemptions motivate 
business growth in Enterprise Zones is something we cannot determine.46    Report No. 24-06 / August 2024Appendix ASections 23-71 through 23-81, HRS

Impact on Low-Income Residents and Hawai‘i Residents
Section 23-71, HRS, also requires us to estimate the “annual cost of the exemption [or] exclusion ... per 
low-income resident of the State.”  The statute defines “low-income resident” as a state resident who is 
(1) the only member of a family of one and has an income of not more than 80 percent of the area median 
income for a family of one; or (2) part of a family with an income of not more than 80 percent of the area 
median income for a family of the same size.  Applying that definition, we find an estimated 480,801 “low-
income residents” statewide in 2020 based on data provided by the Department of Business, Economic 
Development and Tourism.  Using that number of low-income residents, we calculate the cost of each 
exemption per low-income resident, included in the table below.
We also include in the table below the cost of each exemption per Hawai‘i resident, regardless of income 
level.  Such cost is calculated using Hawai‘i’s 2022 resident population of 1,440,196 people.  The results 
in the table below follow and include the Auditor’s tax expenditure estimates only; they do not factor in 
DOTAX expenditure estimates.

Report No. 24-06 / August 2024THIS REPORT ASSESSES  nine exemptions under the Hawai‘i’s General 
Excise Tax (GET) and Use Tax laws.  Section 23-71 et seq., Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes (HRS), require the Auditor to review GET and Use Tax 
provisions annually, on a 10-year recurring cycle.
Specifically, this report reviews the following nine exemptions:
•	GET exemption for employee benefit plans,  
Section 237-24.3(4), HRS;
•	GET exemption for food stamps and vouchers under the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, 
Section 237-24.3(5), HRS;
•	GET exemption for prescriptions and prosthetics,  
Section 237-24.3(6), HRS;
•	GET exemption for merchants association dues for advertising  
or promotion, Section 237-24.3(8), HRS;
•	GET exemption for labor organization real property leases,  
Section 237-24.3(9), HRS;
•	GET exemption for reimbursements to the Hawai‘i Convention  
Center operator from the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority,  
Section 237-24.75(2), HRS;Auditor’s Summary

In fiscal year 2022, 
which ended  
June 30, 2022,  
GET revenue 
accounted for 
$4.01 billion, or 
38.3 percent of the 
State’s total tax 
revenue from all 
sources.Report No. 24-06 / August 2024Review of General Excise and Use Tax Provisions Pursuant to Section 23-76, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes
•	GET exemption for wage and fringe benefit reimbursements to professional 
employer organizations, Section 237-24.75(3), HRS; and
•	Two GET exemptions for Enterprise Zones, regarding both qualified Enterprise  
Zone businesses and Enterprise Zone construction contractors,  
Section 209E-11, HRS.
We determined that six GET exemptions are meeting their stated or inferred 
purposes.  We could not determine whether three GET exemptions were achieving 
their purposes.  As we explain in the report, making conclusions as to whether 
purposes are being met is challenging when amounts claimed are not tracked 
or where no benchmarks or metrics are set forth in statute to assess whether a 
provision is achieving its intended purpose.
