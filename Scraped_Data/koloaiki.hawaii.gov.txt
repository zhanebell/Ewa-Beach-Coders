Executive Summary  
Shorelines are one of our planet’s most dynamic physical features and Hawaii’s are no exception. 
Communities along our shores have flourished for centuries in harmony with the ebb and flow of the tide s, 
punctuated by the occasional devastating hurricane or tsunami  event . However, rapid warming of the 
atmosphere and oceans , caused by two centuries of unabated carbon emissions , is causing increasing 
rates of sea level rise , unprecedented in human history , that threaten s natural environments and 
development on low -lying coasts .  
Sea level rise is an inevitable outcome of global warming  that will continue through many centuries even if 
human -generated global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were stopped today . However, much of what 
happens with future sea level rise will depend on our ability , or inability,  to implement aggressive global 
carbon emissions reduction  programs envisioned through the 2016 Paris Climate Accord .    
This Sea Level Rise Vulnerability a nd Adaptation Report (Report) , initially mandated by Act 83  in 2014  
(Hawaii Climate Change Adaptation Initiative)  and expan ded by Act 32 in 2017 ( Hawaiʻi Climate Change 
Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative ), provides the first state -wide assessment of Hawa ii’s vulnerability to 
sea level rise and recommend ations  to reduce our exposure and sensitivity to sea level rise and increase 
our capacity to adapt . This Report  combines  the best available science  on climate change and sea level 
rise from sources such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Asse ssment Report 5 
(IPCC 2014) , more recent  scientific reports from  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA)  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ), as w ell as the best -available  peer-
reviewed scientific research articles . The R eport also provides recommendations based on emerging good

Program, King Tide’s Project  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
v practices and framed through e xtensive s takeholder consultations . The Report is considered a “living” 
output that will be updated as new information becomes available . The update proc ess will be guided by 
learning questions crafted around the assumptions and limitations that need to be revisited over time  as 
climate science evolves and new challenges appear on the horizon . While the Report focuses on sea level 
rise vulnerabilities and adaptation, it should also strengthen our State’s resolve to  do our part in  reduc ing 
GHG  emissions  in line with Act 32 and the Paris Climate Accord . In addition, this report is intended to serve 
as a framework for identifying and managing other climate change threats  facing  Hawai ‘i.  
 
Hawaiʻi Climate Adaptation Initiative Framework Applied to Sea Level Rise  
Sea Level Rise Outlook  
While the Earth’s climate experiences  natural change  and variabilit y over  geologic time, the changes that 
have occurred  over the last century due to human input of GHGs  into the at mosphere are unprecedented. 
The rapid build -up of GHGs , including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, from 
humans, i s causing global warming and climate disruption. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere is well outside the range of natural variability and is now approaching 410 parts per million  
(Scripps Institution of Oceanography 2015) ; about 4 0 percent ( %) higher than pre -industrial levels and the 
highest in at least  800,000 y ears and probably as long as 3 million years . 
Sea level is rising at increasing rates due to global warming of the atmosphere and oceans  and melting of 
the glaciers and ice sheets . Rising sea level and projections of stronger and more frequent El Niño even ts 
and tropical cyclones in waters surrounding Hawai‘i  all indicate a growing vulnerability to coastal flooding 
and erosion. While the IPCC ’s “business as usual”  scenario , where GHG  emissions continue at the current 
rate of increase,  predicts up to 3.2 fee t of global sea level rise by year 2100  (IPCC 2014) , recent 
observations and projections suggest that this magnitude of sea level rise could occur as early as  year 
2060  under more recently published highest -end scenarios  (Sweet et al. 2017) . As such, q uestions remain 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
vi around the exact timing of that rise due largely to uncertainties around future behavior of Earth’s cryosphere 
and global GHG emission trajectories.  For this reason, it is vital that the magnitude and rate of sea level 
rise is tracked as new projections emerge, plan for 3.2 feet of sea level rise now, and be ready to adjust 
that projection upward. It  is also important to recognize that global sea level  rise will not stop at the year 
2100 , but will likely continue on for centuries.

vii Methodology  
Modeling, using the best available data and methods, was conducted to d etermine the potential future 
exposure of each island to multiple coastal hazards as a result of sea level rise. Three chronic flooding 
hazards were modeled: passive “bathtub” flooding, annual high wave floodin g, and coastal erosion . The 
footprint s of these three hazards were combined to define the projected extent of chronic flooding due to 
sea level rise, called the sea level rise exposure area (SLR -XA). Not all hazards were modeled for each 
island due to limited historical information and geospatial data . Each of these hazards were modeled for 
four future sea level rise scenarios: 0. 5 feet, 1.1 feet, 2.0  feet and 3.2 feet  based on the upper end of the 
IPCC , Assessment Report 5 , representative concentration pathway  8.5, or “business as usual” sea level 
rise scenario .

Using the outputs of this coastal hazard modeling, vulnerability was assessed for the main Hawaiian 
Islands. Vulnerability is the result of exposure to a hazard, sensitivity or susceptibility to harm, and lack of 
capacity to cope and adapt. A vulnerability assessment estimates the potential social, cultural, economic, 
and environmental impacts of this exposure and provides important information needed to design 
appropriate strategies and use the right tools to adapt to sea level ri se. This assessment determined the 
vulnerability of valued assets such as land, homes, beaches, cultural sites, roads, and other critical 
infrastructure to sea level rise.  
Results  Overview  
Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use , people, property, cultural and natural 
resources , and critical infrastructure.  As the only U.S. state that is an island, Hawaiʻi is highly vulnerable to 
the effects of sea level rise.  Vulnerability to sea level rise is based on modeling chronic coastal f looding 
with sea level rise due to passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA. Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
viii Although this Report provides a range of sea level rise projections and vulnerability scenarios, the SLR -XA 
with 3.2 feet of sea level rise was chosen to depict hazards that may occur in the mid to latter half of this 
century.  Vulnerability to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term 
exposure to coastal hazards and sea level rise.  All sea level rise r esults from both the hazard modeling and 
vulnerability assessment are available to view on the  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  
(http://hawaiisealevelri seviewer.org/ ). 
 
 
 Summary of Key Terms, Assumptions, and Limitations in the Methodology Used to Assess 
Vulnerability in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR -XA) 
This summary is intended  to help the reader become familiar with key terms, assumptions, and limitations in the 
modeling and vulnerability assessment methodology.  
 The SLR -XA depicts the area exposed to potential chronic flooding and land loss based on modeling 
passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion w ith sea level rise for the islands of 
Maui, O‘ahu, and Kaua‘i. The SLR -XA for the islands of Hawaiʻi, Molokai, and Lāna‘i is based on 
modeling passive flooding only.  
 Flooding in the SLR -XA is associated with long -term, chronic hazards punctuated by annual or more 
frequent flooding events. Over time, recurring flooding at the highest tides in low -lying areas leads to 
chronic flooding and then to permanent flooding, and permanent loss.  
 Vulnerability in the SLR -XA is characterized as potential impacts to land  use, people and property, 
critical infrastructure, Native Hawaiian communities, cultural resources, and coastal resources, 
including beaches.  
Key assumptions and limitations of the vulnerability assessment include:  
 Potential economic loss is based on pr esent values of the land and structures from the county tax 
parcel database permanently lost in the SLR -XA. 
 Economic (monetary) losses due to sea level rise on critical infrastructure (such as roads, airports, 
harbors, water, sewer and power, etc.) has not  been considered, but many such structures or facilities 
that are located in the SLR -XA have been identified in this Report.  
 A more detailed economic loss analysis of Oahu’s critical infrastructure, including harbor facilities, 
airport facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads is needed. State and County agencies should 
consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as early 
as possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the co st of maintaining and 
repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in place over the next 30 to 70 years.  
 Macro -economic impacts (such as on tourism or the real estate market) resulting from potential 
chronic flooding over time caused by sea lev el rise are not analyzed.  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
ix Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  (SLR -XA) 
Chronic flooding  in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise would render over 25,800 acres of land in the 
State unusable. Some of that land will have eroded into the oce an, some will become  submerged by inches 
or feet of standing water, and some areas will be dry most of the year , but repeatedly washed over by 
seasonal high waves . State -wide, about 34% of that potentially lost land is designated for urban use, 25% 
is designated  for agricultural use , and 40% is designated  for conserva tion. The loss of urban land could  put 
pressure o n development of inland areas, including  those designated as  agricultural and conservation 
lands.  
Across the state, over 6,500 structures locat ed near the shoreline would be compromise d or lost in the 
SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise . Some of these vulnerable structures include  hotels , shopping malls,  
and small businesses . The loss of these structures  may result in the interruption, relocat ion, or even  closure 
of those businesses. Other types of  structures  which may be impacted are churches, schools, and 
community centers. In addition,  houses and apartment buildings  are also vulnerable and the loss of these 
structures  would result in over 20 ,000 displaced residents in need of new homes. The value of projected 
flooded structures, combined with the land value of the 25,800 acres projected to be flooded, amounts to 
over $19 billion across the State. Hotspots for potential economic loss across th e State are centered in 
urban areas with the greatest potential loss in Honolulu on  the Island of  O‘ahu , with 66% of the total state -
wide economic loss,  due to the density and economic assets potentially exposed to sea level rise . As a 
result, the impacts of sea level rise on O‘ahu could generate substantial social, infrastructure, and economic 
impacts with ripple effects throughout the State. 
It should be noted that t he $19 billion in economic loss does not encompass the full loss potential in the 
State.  Monetary  losses  that will occur from the c hronic flooding of roads, utilities and other public 
infrastructure were  not analyzed in this report and may amount to  an order of magnitude greater than the 
potential economic loss es from land and s tructures . For e xample, o ver 38 miles of major roads would be 
chronically flooded across the State with 3.2 feet of sea level rise , ranging from residential roads to sections 
of coastal highways such as Kūhiō  Highway on Kauaʻi, Kamehameha Highway on O‘ahu, and Honoa piʻilani 
Highway on Maui. Utilities, such as water, wastewater and electrical systems often run parallel  and 
underneath roadways, making lost road mileage a good indication of the extent of los t utilities. This 
chronically flooded infrastructure would have significant impacts on local communities as well as 
reverberating effects around each island through loss of commerce, loss of access to emergency services, 
and increased traffic on other road s and highways. Repair and relocation of vulnerable roadways are 
already costly efforts for the State and Counties, which will only worsen as  sea level rises. In addition, many 
of our h arbor and airport  facilities are often located in low -lying coastal are as of the State  and face the 
problem of chronic flooding. For this reason, the economic loss due to flooded critical infrastructure may be 
an order of magnitude greater than the potential economic loss from land and structures.

Hawaiʻi  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
xi The loss of invaluable natural and cultural resources across all islands is even harder to quantify , yet their 
loss would cost the State dearly  due to their intrinsic value . Beaches that provi de for recreation, wildlife 
habitat , and cultural tradition will erode, from iconic sites such as Sunset Beach on O‘ahu to neighborhood 
beach access points rarely visited by anyone except local residents . Some beaches could be lost entirely 
if their landwa rd migration is blocked by roads, structures, shoreline  armoring , or geology. The flooding of 
the over 2, 000 on -site sewage disposal systems  located in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise could 
result in diminished water quality. The loss of and har m to native species and entire ecosystems will have 
implications for Hawaiian cultural traditions and practices , which are closely tied to  the natural environment. 
Further, nearly 550 cultural sites in the State would be flooded and many Hawaiian Home Land s 
communities would  be impacted by flooding. In some cases, these natural and cultural resources could be 
allowed to migrate inland or carefully relocated. In other cases, the resources a re inextricably bound to 
place and would be permanently altered by fl ooding.  
Opportunities and Challenges  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, as sea level rises, homes and businesses located on or near the shoreline 
throughout the State will beco me exposed to chronic flooding. Portions of coastal roads may become 
flooded, eroded,  impassible, and potentially irreparable, jeopardizing access to and from many 
communities. The flooding of hotels and transportation systems would impact the visitor economy and thus 
impact the people whose livelihoods depend on tourism. The impact of sea  level rise on O‘ahu is greater 
than all of the other islands combined due to the size of the population and extensive urbanization of 
vulnerable coastal areas. Even more troubling is the fact that impacts from chronic flooding with sea level 
rise on O‘ahu  can reverberate and translate into economic and social impacts for the other islands.  
The added risk of coastal f looding from hurricanes and tropical cyclones from a warming planet poses a 
potential for loss of human life and property and for severe and long-term economic disruption. Tropical 
storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis create waves  that flood low -lying coastal areas. This ad ded risk from  this 
“event -based ” coastal flooding  exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report. It is important  
though that the reader understands that event -based coastal flooding with sea level rise would alter the 
extent of the area subject to flooding from such events.  
The results of the vulnerability assessment highlight just a few of the very significant cha llenges the State 
faces under a scenario of 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the mid - to latter -part of the century. However, this 
may not be the worst of it. According to recent climate science, sea level rise greater than 6 feet is 
“physically plausible ” by the end of the century  (Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017, Sweet et al. 2017) . 
While not modeled in this Report, additional feet of sea level rise would add thousands of acres to the SLR -
XA on each island (Figure 2). A geographic information sys tem (GIS) analysis using layers from the NOAA 
Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 2017b ), which only accounts for passive flooding, indicates that an additional 
10,000 acres state -wide would be added to the SLR -XA with 5 feet of sea level rise. This would increase 
the total area exposed to chronic flooding State -wide to over 36,000 acres an d the economic, 
environmental, cultural and societal impacts of which would be far greater than the results presented in this Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
xii Report. Each island’s exposure to passive flooding wi th 5 feet of sea level varies due to its geomorphology 
with O‘ahu having the highest additional exposure (36%) and Maui, the lowest additional exposure (15%) 
in terms of additional acres passively flooded with 5 feet of sea level rise.  
 
Potential addition al area of chronic flooding with 5 feet of sea level rise  
The threat of 3 feet or more of sea level rise in this century is real and is not likely to diminish given the 
overall trend in scientific research toward higher and more rapid scenarios of sea leve l rise in this century. 
This state -wide vulnerability assessment provides a framework for considering sea level rise threats in 
planning decisions by illustrating spatial flooding in this century and providing a framework for adaption. 
Invariably, adaption  to sea level rise will require difficult decisions regarding when, where, and how to act 
on this information.    
Recommendations  
Recommendations  were developed to  provide guidance for State and County agencies, communities, and 
other stakeholders for  improving our capacity to adapt to sea level rise. These recommendations were 
compiled through a comprehensive literature review ; interviews, workshops , and meetings with a wide 
range of stakeholders ; and quarterly consultations with the Hawaiʻi Climate C ommission . The 
recommendations are designed to support a multi -sectoral and holistic response to adaptation building on 
existing efforts  and considering challenges and new opportunities.   
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
xiii Recommendation 1 , support sustainable and resilient  land use and community development, focuses on 
the central role that land use and community develo pment planning play in adapting to sea level rise. A 
Recommended Action  under Recommendation 1 is to recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
as a state -wide vulnerability zone for planning at state , county, and community  levels. It is further 
recommended that a  land inventory be conducted in each county to identify urban areas that could support 
a managed retreat  strategy.   
 
Recommendations to improve Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise  
 
Recommendations 2  and 3 support Recommendation  1, through prioritizing smart redevelopment in areas 
outside the SLR -XA, limiting exposure inside the SLR -XA, and incentivizing  improved  flood risk 
management . In prioritizing smart redevelopment in areas outside the SLR -XA, under Recommendation 2, 
each c ounty is encouraged to identify priority target areas for smart redevelopment . The State should 
consider developing design standards as best management practice s for building  in the SLR-XA with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise . Also u nder Recommendation 2, the potential impacts of sea level rise provide new 
opportunities to use land more sustainably by identifying and prioritizing areas for smart redevelop ment 
within existing urban land boundaries  and to minimize pressure on agriculture and conservation lands. 
Further, the identification of s horeline protection , conservation,  and restoration  priorities  are needed to 
make decisions on shoreline armoring.  Finally, Recommendation 3 seek s to incentivize improved flood risk 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
xiv management through support to a state -wide Community Rating System program, encouraging property 
owners outside currently regulated flood zones to purchase flood insurance, and incorporate sea level rise 
in hazard mitigation plan updates and disaster recovery frameworks.  
Recommendations 4, 5, and 6 address cultural and environmental vulnerabilities that underpin resilient and 
sustainable land use and community development.  A state -wide assessment of legacy beach conservation 
priorities is suggested as a Recommended Action under Recommendation 4 for enabling beaches to persist 
with sea level rise.  An inventory, protocols, and process are needed to preserve Native Hawaiian culture 
and communities with sea level rise  as part of Recommendation 5. For Recommendation 6, a 
comprehensive review of environment al regulations that allow for the siting of environmental hazards, such 
as hazardous materials/waste storage facilities and onsite wastewater storage systems is needed to protect 
nearshore water quality with rising seas.  
Finally, cross -cutting recommendati ons include developing funding sources and incentives for adaptation 
(Recommendation 7), supporting research, assessment, and monitoring of changing conditions 
(Recommendation 8), and promoting collaboration and accountability for adaptation  (Recommendatio n 9). 
These cross -cutting recommendations highlight the need to engage diverse stakeholders in making 
complex decisions about addressing  the impacts of sea level rise.  Recommendation 7 highlights the very 
real need to address the cost of adaptation by expl oring both f unding sources and incentives  while  
Recommendation 8 is f undamental to a learning approach to adaptation which involves  conducting  
research, assessment s, and monitoring needed to update the Report and other “living” outputs.  
This Report should serve  as a baseline for understanding the most probable impacts of sea level rise and 
should be used to  as a tool by the  decision  makers of the State, the C ounties, and communit y leaders . 
Recommendations  to increase our capacity to adapt to sea level rise are described , but do not lay  out a 
plan for implementation. The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission provides a collaborative multisectoral forum for 
furthering discussions on how, when, and where to implement many of these recommendations. Some 
recommendations were identified through stakeholder consultations as priorities to be fast -tracked for 
discussion and action. In addition, sequencing considerations and synergies among the recommendations 
need to be recognized and planned for.  Overall, we have enough information now to take action to address 
the inevitable  near and me dium -term rise of sea level.

1 Introduction  
‘A‘ohe pu‘u ki‘eki‘e ke ho‘ā‘o ‘ia e pi‘i.  No cliff is so tall that 
it cannot be scaled. No problem is too great when one 
tries hard to solve it.  
There is  an ‘ōlelo no‘eau, a Ha waiian proverb, that speaks of 
humans' relationship to  the ‘āina, the land. He ali‘i ka ‘āina; he 
kauwā ke kanaka. "The land is chief; man is its servant." According 
to Hawaiian histor ian Mary Kawena P uku‘i (Pukui 1983) , “Land has 
no need for man, but man needs the land and works for its 
livelihood.” T o Hawaiians, land provides everything that is needed 
for man to survive. It is our responsibility to care for the land so that 
it continues to provide the necessary resources for survival suc h as 
food, water, and shelter. However, if we neglect  the āina, then the 
āina will neglect us . 
We are now facing the consequences of what happens when we neglec t the āina on a  global scale. Global 
anthropo genic  impacts on the climate ha ve potentially done irreparable harm to ecosystems around the 
world  and no w the  earth is  responding, showing us who truly is the chief . While natural disasters are not 
new to Hawai‘i, their intensity and frequency have increased and will continue to increase. We have already 
begun to experience the effects of a rising sea inunda ting areas across the islands. The solutions to our 
forthcoming challenges will be complicated. It will require policymakers, engineers, residents, scientists , 
planners , and more, to adapt our current development  practices and  to build a network of solutio ns. If there 
is one take -away from our experience with climate change, we have proven that humans have the capacity 
to modify Earth’s biosphere in ways that are harmful to life. It seems reasonable , therefore , that we have 
the capacity to undo the negative  impacts of climate change on our society, but it will depend on our 
willingness and capability to embrace climate mitigation and adaptation strategies as early as possible.  
The link between human greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , climate warming, and sea le vel rise is clea r 
and well documented both globally and in Hawaiʻi. Globally -averaged sea level is rising at increasing rates 
due to climate and ocean warming caused by increasing concentrations of GHGs  (carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide and fluorinat ed gases) in the atmosphere from human activity, particularly from burning of 
fossil fuels and land  use changes.  In addition, t here is a large and growing body of scientific evidence that 
accelerated melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets may co ntribute to 3 feet or more of sea level 
rise b efore the end of this century. D espite the findings of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  
(IPCC ) Assessment Report 5 ( AR5) (IPCC 2014) , which p roject s 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the end o f this 
century under the “business as usual” GHG  emission s scenario (and which forms the basis of our sea level 
rise modeling effort ), recent peer -reviewed publications indicate that 3.2 feet of sea level rise may be 
 
Call to Action  
“We are all at -risk due to the limited 
sense of urgency to address sea level 
rise. We need a broad -based, multi -
faceted education, talk story at all levels 
to ensure people know the issues, their 
risks and how to respond accordingly. A 
call to kuleana, E Ala E, a prepared 
community, Pili na mea apau.”  
Group message de veloped during the 1st 
Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and 
Adaptation Workshop  
O‘ahu , January 2016  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
2 reached earlier in the second half of t his century and that 6 feet of sea level rise or more is “physically 
plausible ” by the end this century (Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017, NASA 2015, Sweet et al. 2017) . 
Three  feet of sea level rise within the  latter half of this century appears increasingly likely, given the 
predominant trend of the research  toward higher scenarios  of sea level rise. Whether we see 3 or 6 feet of 
sea level rise in this century or next will depend primarily on humankind’s abili ty to mitigate GHG  emissions 
over the next few decades and the response of Earth’s polar regions to warming. Impacts from climate 
change  and sea level rise are occurring now and will inevitably increase over several generations . Planning 
for sea level rise  must begin in earnest while we work in parallel to mitigate clim ate change.  If no action is 
taken, these negative impacts will ripple through Hawaii’s economy causing great s ocial and economic 
disruption. Fortunately, we are in a position to anticipate an d plan for sea level rise , thereby reducing, but 
not eliminating, its effects.  
This Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report (Report) provides, for the first time, a state -wide 
assessment of  our exposure to sea level rise and its potential socia l, economic, and environmental impacts 
to our islands. While the focus of the assessment is on 
the main Hawaiian Islands, vulnerability and 
adaptation to sea level rise needs to be addressed for 
the archipelago as a whole ( Figure 1). The Report fills 
in important data gaps in projected exposure and 
vulnerability to chronic coastal flooding  from modeling 
passive marine and groundwater flooding , coastal 
erosion,  and annual high wave flooding  under higher 
sea level.

Vulnerability and Adaptation (IPCC 2007)  
Vulnerabi lity is the degree to which a system is 
susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse 
effects of climate change, including climate 
variability and extremes.   
Adaptation  (planned) is the result of a deliberate 
policy decision, based on an awareness that  
conditions have changed or are about to change and 
that action is required to return to, maintain, or 
achieve a desired state.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
3 Our Kuleana as Stewards of the Future  
Although s ea level rise may alter Hawai i’s future, we have the capacity to moderate its deleterious effects.  
We alone possess the human qualities that allow us to build  a resilient future together .1 Our Native Hawaiian 
community has taught us how to apply traditional  cultural  knowledge  to solve problems of resource 
management . This includes the revitalization of  the ahupua‘a land  system which was a section of land that 
ran from mauka ( inland ) to makai (sea ward ) and the size of the ahupua‘a was dependent on the resources 
of the area. The ahupua‘a was thought of as the basic self -sustaining unit an d emphasized the 
interrelationship of the elements (nature) and beings (humans). Further, Hawai‘i is often referred to as a 
“melting pot” of cultures which allow s us access to the multicultural knowledge and heritage embodied in 
our residents. Our unique cultural heritage provides us a broa der spectrum of ideas and possible solutions 
which  makes us stronger and more resilient to face all crisis and challenges together.  
This Report is intended to reach the wide range of stakeholders needed to envision, plan, and design a 
future with rising se as so we can all be stewards  of the ‘āina . This Report is not a plan but a technical 
document that provides projections of areas along the coast that are vulnerab le to sea level rise based on 
the latest available science and state of the art modeling. Reco mmendations to address risks from sea level 
rise focus on improving our capacity to adapt and build  resilient communities . As this report is also 
considered a “living document,” the results  should  provide a picture of our future with sea level rise , with 
the understanding that this “picture” is  based on many assumptions and limitations that will need to be 
reviewed and updated as new science and modeling emerge  and efforts to adapt are tried and tested . 
Who Should Read this Report?  
State Legislators  Devel op policies and laws that will strengthen Hawaii ’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise and 
support sustainable and resilient communities and the environment.

1 Many of our unique island challenges and qualities were captured as messages in break -out groups during the State’s first Sea 
Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Workshop  attended by 250 participants on January 26, 2016. Some of these messages are 
included in “Call to Action” text boxes at the beginning of each chapter of this Report.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
4 Key Milestones in Hawaii ’s Climate Change Policy  
The risks posed by climate change and sea level rise to Hawaiʻi were recognized as early as 1984 by  State 
Senate Resolution 137 that requested a study the worldwide greenhouse effect on Hawaii’s coastal 
development. The resulting report, Effects on Hawaii of a Worldwide Rise in Sea Level Induced by the 
Greenhouse Effect,  was released in 1985 by the Hawai ‘i Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program. This 
report, delivered to the State legislature, stated that the debate has shifted from questioning the possibility 
that the "Greenhouse Eff ect" would occur to whether the effect will be mild or severe as well as the 
timeframe for its imminent occurrence.  
Hawaii ’s first iteration of a c limate change a ction plan was completed in 1998. The Hawaiʻi Climate Change 
Action Plan  did not set specific goals , but was intended to be a catalyst for discussions by Hawaii’s  people 
about their involvement in future efforts to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The 
major recommendation o f this first plan was to develop consensus as to Hawaii’s  goals for GHG  emission 
reductions.  
Hawaii ’s first sustainability plan was requested  in 2005 through Act 8 , Special Session Laws of Hawai ‘i 
(SLH ), to review the precepts of the Hawai ‘i State Plan an d other fundamental components of community 
planning. Specifically, many quality of life issues  were addressed  including water quality, air quality, land 
use, energy, and ocean resources for planning Hawaii’s  future. Act 8  also called the plan to be  update d 
every ten  years. The Hawai ‘i 2050 Sustainability Plan , published in 2008, warned of global warming, rising 
sea levels, and that stronger, more frequent storms would impact Hawai ‘i. The  plan also established many 
goals and recommendations, in cluding strat egic actions to red uce reliance on fossil fuels; conserve water 
and ensure an adequate water supply; conduct research to strengthen management initiatives  to respond 
to rising sea levels, coastal hazards, erosion, and other natural hazards; and develop a c omprehensive 
environmental mapping and measurement system to evaluate the overall health and status of Hawaii ’s 
natural ecosystems. The plan set a 2020 target date to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels by benchmarking 
that 20  percent ( %) of electricity be  generated from renewable resources by the end of 2020.  
In 2009 , the multi -stakeholder Ocean Resources Management Plan (ORMP) Working Group, establish ed 
by the Hawai ʻi CZM Program, developed a  Framework for Climate Change Adaptation in Hawaiʻi  as part of 
the ORMP implementation (State of Hawaii’s ORMP Working Group 2009) . Core values for adaptation to 
climate change were established  to provide  a: 
 Safe environment for residents and v isitors; 
 Healthy  environment that prom otes human well -being and sustainable ecosystem services ; 
 Productive  environment that enables residents to thrive ; and  
 Resilient  environment that is able to withs tand shocks to the system  
This framework provided initial guidelines on how the State could plan for adaptation to the impacts of 
climate change (State of Hawaii’s ORMP Working Group 2009) . Building on this effort, a policy toolkit was 
developed in 2011 for state and local g overnments  to address sea level rise and coastal land us e in Hawaiʻi Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
5 (Codiga and Wager 2011) . In addition, the ORMP, a state -wide plan updated every 5 years  which  sets forth 
the State’ s ocean and coastal resource management priorities , identified “appropriate coastal development ” 
and “managing coastal hazards ” as the top two  managem ent priorities  in its 2013 update  (Hawai'i CZM 
Program 2013) . 
 BACK TO THE FUTURE  
Over 30 years ago, the Hawaiʻi CZM Program submitted the report, Effects on Hawai ʻi of a Worldwide Rise in 
Sea Level Induced by the Greenhouse Effect  (Hawai'i CZM Program 1985) , to the State legislature. Maps 
showed es timated projection s of sea level rise in Honolulu and  highlighted the uncertainty regarding the 
magnitude and rate of sea level rise.  While at the time, the report concluded there was insufficient basis for 
formulating a long -range plan, the recommendation s below  are still valid today.  
1. Adopt sea level rise projections for planning purposes based upon the best data and scientific predictions 
available;  
2. Review and revise the adopted sea level projections at regular intervals;  
3. Plot the approximate locations of  shorelines and coastal hazards based on the adopted or amended sea 
level projections;  
4. Use the projected shoreline and coastal hazard maps in the design and location of new public facilities and 
in the improvement and alteration of existing facilities, bas ed on their lifespan and safety features;  
5. Locate new infrastructural facilities as a means to attract development to "safe" areas away from zones of 
projected hazard. Considerations may include the maintenance or non -maintenance of the existing 
infrastruct ure; 
6. Adopt more innovative uses of the economic incentives of the National Flood Insurance Program to 
encourage appropriate changes in existing patterns of development;  
7. Require stricter adherence to existing prohibitions against shoreline development (e.g. , shoreline setback, 
special management permits, and conservation district uses) by approving fewer variances, waivers, and 
exemptions; and  
8. Consider more seriously the viability of replacing structures lost to natural forces and situated within areas 
subje ct to impact from rising sea levels.  
The impacts of sea level rise are already being felt in Hawai ʻi. 
We cannot afford to wait another 30 years to act!
 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
6 The Hawai ‘i State Planning Act ( Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS), Chapter 226)  was amended in 2011 to 
include  Sustainability Priority Guidelines and Principals  (Act 181 , SLH  2011 ). These guidelines were 
created to encourage collaboration needed to promote and implement sustainability through economic, 
social, community, and environmental priorities, through planning that respects and promotes living within 
the natural resourc es and limits of the State, by promoting decisions based on meeting the needs of the 
present without compromising the needs of the future, considering the principles of the ahupua ‘a system 
and emphasiz ing that everyone has the responsibility for achieving a sustainable Hawai ‘i. 
The Hawai‘i State Planning Act was again amended in 2012 with the addition of the Climate Change 
Adaptation Priority Guidelines (Act 286)  (Box 1). These guidelines were created to encourage  the 
collaboration needed to address climate change by recognizing that impacts will occur in multiple sectors 
including agriculture, conservation lands, coastal and nearshore marine areas, natural and cultural 
resources, education, energy, higher education,  health, historic preservation, water resources, the built 
environment, and the economy (State of Hawai‘i Senate 2012) . 
In 2013, Hawai‘i became the first sub -national signatory of the International Majuro Declaration for Climate 
Leadership  after then -Governor Neil Abercrombie became one of eight governors appointed by the U.S. 
President to the State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience . 
The 2014 Hawaiʻi State Legislature unanimously passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 69 (SCR 69), 
“Endorsing and Supporting the Aloha+ Challenge.” The Aloha+ Challenge, He Nohona ‘Ae‘oia  - A Culture 
of Sustainability, is guided by and builds upon the sustain ability definition, goals, and principles (Box 2) 
which established sustainability as a State priority.  
In 2014 , the Hawaiʻ i State Legislature also passed Act 83, which formally established The Hawaiʻi  Climate 
Adap tation Initiative  to enable a coordinated approach among all agencies at all levels of government to 
plan for and address the effects of climate change to protect the State’s economy, health, environment, and 
way of life. Act 83 established a coordinating body to carry out this mission known as the Interagency 
Climate Adaptation Committee (ICAC) composed of  State and County government representatives. Their 
first task was to develop  this Report to address the state -wide impacts of sea level rise . In additio n, they 
were also tasked to  develop plans and policy recommendations for action, and with the coordination of the 
State of Hawai ʻi Office of Planning (O ffice of Planning ), to then use this Report as a model framework for 
addressing other climate threats an d priorities.

8 In 2015 , Hawaiʻ i became the first state to require 100 % renewable power  supply  by year 2045 (Act 97,  SLH 
2015). This included o ther climate mitigation measures passed by the State legislature such as Act 99, SLH 
2015 and Act 176, SLH 2016 which  direct ed all public schools and university campuses to become energy 
net-zero by year 2035 . Other measures established a community -based renewable energy program to allow 
condominium dwellers and others who have been largely unable to participat e in Hawaii’s clean energy 
transformation to purchase electricity generated at an off -site renewable energy facility (Act 100, SLH  
2015), and designated a state hydrogen implementation coordinator to promote fuel cell technology (Act 
98, SLH 2015).  
In 2017 , The Hawai‘i Climate Adaptation Initiative  (Act 83, SLH 2014 ), was strengthened  through the 
passing of Act 32, The Hawai‘i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative  which expand ed the 
ICAC into the Hawaiʻ i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptatio n Commission ( Hawaiʻ i Climate 
Commissi on) (Box 3). The Ha waiʻi Climate Commission was assigned  various tasks related to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation  including systematically reducing GHG emissions and i mproving Hawaii’s  
resiliency to climate change aligned with the principals and contributing to the goals established by the 
2014 Paris Accord (Act 32, SLH 2017).  Through  all these efforts, Hawaiʻ i has laid a solid foundation for 
adapting to climate change,  reducing GHG emissions, and charting a new course to protect the State’s 
economy, health, environment, and way of life.

9 The Hawai ‘i Clim ate Change Mitigation and Adaptation  Initiative  
(Act 32)  
The Hawai‘i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Initiative  (Act 32, SLH 2017)  strengthens support 
for the creation of a framework to address climate threats . The framework  begins with an i nitial focus on 
sea level rise  (this Report) and allows that framework to be  used to address other climate impacts such as 
changes in rainfall patterns that will affect our water supply, agriculture, invasive species, and ecosyst ems. 
Other impacts might include increasing  air temperature and  incidence of heat waves which will result in 
human health impacts such as increased  respiratory and mosquito -borne diseases, increas ed ocean 
temperatures and acidity which will reduce the health and resilience of our coral reefs and ocean resources, 
and more frequent natural disasters which could pose significant risk for the islands.  
Act 32 also establishes  the following tasks for the Hawaiʻi  Climate Commission  as related to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation:  
 Provide policy direction, facilitation, coordination, and planning among state and county agencies, 
federal agencies, and o ther partners as appropriate;   
 Establish climate change mitigation and adaptation goals to help guide pl anning and 
implementation state -wide using the latest scientific analysis and risk assessment to monitor and 
forecast climate change related impacts at  the regional, state, and local level, including any 
additional information deemed necessary ;  
 Identify vulnerable people, communities, industries, ecosystems, and the potential economic 
ramifications for climate change related impacts;  
 Identify existing climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts at the federal, state, and local 
levels and make recommendations for how to meet or exceed Hawaii’s  state mitigation goals and 
adopt a liberal approach in preparation, so as to minimize future risk to the pe ople and 
environment of Hawai‘i;  
 Assess the capacity and availability of existing resources and identify new source of revenue 
necessary to address climate change mitigation and adaptation and advise the governor, 
legislature, and counties on the economic  and budgetary ramifications of climate change impacts, 
mitigation, and adaptation;  
 Identify information necessary to track progress in implementing climate change mitigation and 
adaptation efforts and submit an annual report to the governor and legislatu re;  
 Maintain a website that includes a mission statement as well as access to climate change related 
actions, plans, policies, and results; and  
 Conduct a comprehensive review of the implementation as required by the Act.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
10 Hawai ʻi Clim ate Adaptation Framework  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Adaptation F ramework was developed as a process for science -driven and 
stakeholder -informed analysis of sea level rise an d other climate change -related issue s. The key 
components of this framework are: (1 ) stakeholder outreach and engagement, (2) vul nerability assessment, 
and (3)  “living” outputs which are informed by the climate science and traditional and local knowledge and 
revised through a learning process (Figure 2). Emphasis is place d on the use of the best available science 
combined with traditional and local knowledge and practices  to assess our vulnerability and to increase our 
capacity to adapt by applying an integrated learning approach. This framework w as used to guide the 
development of th is Report  (Figure 3). A summary of each component of the f ramework is described in this 
section together with specific activities  and outputs  conducted as par t of the developme nt of the  Report .

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
12 Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement  
Stakeholder outreach and engagement are designed to inform a broad constituen cy of the current and 
projected threats from climate change and sea level rise and work together to develop adaptation 
responses. Multiple forums, such as focus groups, workshops, and storytelling, are used to seek input on 
adaptation challenges and recomm endations that can be used to inform the other components of the 
framework. Key questions addressed through these forums include d: 
 What climat e variables (e.g., sea level rise, changing rainfall, rising atmospheric and ocean 
temperature) should we focus on ? 
 What are the issues and concerns related to those climate variables?  
 What lessons can be used to address these issues and concerns?  
 What are “no regrets” strategies that should be adopted?  
 What we are doing now that we should stop doing?  
 What we are not doing that we should be doing?  
The following is a brief summary of stakeholder outreach and engagement conducted as a part of this 
Report . 
Quarterly  public meetings of the ICAC  (now called the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission)  were held to educate 
the Committee regarding the science behind the Report and bring in others from different sectors to educat e 
the Committee about their current, ongoing work in dealing with climate change.  T he meetings were also 
used to update the Committee members on the progress to date of the Report and to solicit  their input , as 
well as the public’s input,  on various aspects of the approach being used to develop the Report.  
The State of Hawaiʻi Departmen t of Land and Natural Resources  (DLNR ), in partnership with the ICAC, 
teamed up  with the Department of Education’s Career  and Technical Education  to have students 
participating in their Graphic Design Program of Study design a logo for the Hawai‘i Climate Adaptation 
Initiative. The students were asked to design a creative, innovative, and professional logo that express ed 
the student’s perspective on climate adaptation and how it relate d to the State of Hawai‘i. In preparation for 
the assignment , the student s were also required to write a short paper on climate adaptat ion. All logos were 
given to the DLNR to review and the top five logos were presented to the ICAC at their May 10, 2016 
Meeting where  a winner was selected. The winning logo was designed by Ms. Britney Van Winkle and Ms. 
Tymberlyn T ugaoen of Leilehua High School.  
Focus group meetings were held with State and County agencies and nongovernmental organizations to 
identify specific issues or concerns. From these meetings and other contacts, storytel lers were identified to 
capture issues and ongoing efforts in addressing shoreline problems and loss. These adaptation stories 
document key lessons that can be used to address sea level rise and are incl uded throughout the Report . 
Two stakeholder workshops  were held. The first workshop, held in January 2016 , was open to the public  
and attended by 250 people. The focus of this workshop was to communicate the latest science on climate Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
13 change and sea level rise, provide an overview of the process  that would be  used  to develop the Report, 
solicit issues and concerns about sea level rise, and develop call -to-action messages which are captured 
throughout the Report. The second workshop, held in February 2017, was attended by 150 multidisciplinary 
stakeholders from  government, private sector, and nongovernmental organizations. As in the previous 
workshop, the latest climate science was communicated along with preliminary hazard modeling, 
vulnerability assessment results, and draft recommendations. The primary object ive of this workshop was 
to solicit input on the suite of proposed recommendations and to identify priorit y recommendations  
A series of informational m eeting s were held for County government officials  and the public  for the islands 
of O‘ahu, Kaua‘i, Maui, Hawai‘ i (Hilo and Kona) , and Moloka'i to educate people about the impacts of sea 
level rise  and gather comments and input about key issues and concerns regard ing preparedness and 
adaptation to sea level rise.  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Adaptation Portal  (http://climateadaptation.hawaii.gov/ ) was developed to serve as a 
repository of news and resources on climate change. The website was also used as a forum to disseminate 
information regarding upcoming public events and meetings as well as host videos and summaries from 
past ICAC meetings as well as the workshops held.  
Vulnerability Assessment  
A vulnerability assessment quantifies (where possible) the potent ial social, economic, and environmen tal 
impacts of climate change. Vulnerability is a result of exposure to a hazard, degree of sensitivity or 
susceptibility to harm.  Capacity or inability to cope or adapt (sensitivity) to hazards is the critical link betw een 
understanding hazards and doing something about it.  Key questions addressed in developing the 
vulnerability assessment include:  
 What are key climate change variables and projections of change?  
 How do these climate change variables increase existing haz ards or create new hazards now and 
in the future?  
 What is our spatial and temporal exposure to these hazards? When and where will they occur?  
 What are the potential social, cultural, economic, and environmental impacts of climate change?  
The vulnerability assessment in this Report utilizes the IPCC sea level rise projections  (1.1 feet of sea level 
rise as the setting for demonstrating present -day or near -term flooding and erosion hazards and 3.2 feet of 
sea level rise as the setting for current sea level ri se planning effort s) to create a model of exposure to 
passive flooding, coastal erosion, annual high wave flooding . Under the guidance of the Hawaiʻi Climate 
Commission,  the University of Hawaiʻi School of Ocean, Earth Sciences, and Technology (UH SOEST) , 
and Tetra Tech, Inc.  (Tetra Tech ), a decision was made to aggregate these three  hazards  into a combined 
Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR -XA) for the vulnerability assessment.  A thorough description of the 
methodology and assumptions are provided in Chapter 3 to support more localized assessment of exposure 
and vulnerability and to support update of the Report results as part of the living outpu ts process.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
14 Living Outputs  
The “living outputs ” process recognizes the evolving nature of climate science, technology, and innovation 
that must be considered as we adapt to climate change. This Report is the first outpu t of the living outputs 
process. As r equired under Act 32, this Report will be updated every 5  years. It should not be used or 
viewed as a final, definitive analysis of sea level rise vul nerability, particularly at a site  level. Key questions 
addressed through the living outputs approach incl ude: 
 How is the science evolving on climate change and sea level rise?  
 How can we improve model projections?  
 What can we do to increase our capacity to adapt to climate change?  
 Where are our successes and shortcomings toward adaptation and resilience?  
 How do we set priorities in terms of where, when, and how to adapt?  
 Are the assumptions made still valid?  
 What have we learned from our assumptions? What has changed?  
Sea level r ise will n ot stop at 3.2 feet. The effects of carbon dioxide are long -lived and t here is a large 
degree of “i nertia” in the climate system. Over the next few centuries, seas will continue to rise, although 
the rate of incr ease and timing are uncertain. This Report provides a framework for assessing climate 
change within dynamic physica l and social systems so we can continually adapt its use to new information 
and circumstances. Thus, the results of the vulnerability assessment and recommendations require 
updating based on the best available science and the lessons learned through implem entation and trial.  
This Report  also includes  learning questions designed to  help us re -think critical elements of a sea level 
rise adaptation strategy, as well as scientific and modeling assumptions . Learning questions define  an 
important element of the living outputs process by highlighting issues that require further investigation, 
uncertainties in our knowledge, and known trends that need to be monitored.  
In addition, t his Report incorporates an accessible online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  
(http://hawaiisealevelriseviewer.org/ ), which can also be considered as another “living” output. The Hawai‘i 
Sea Level Rise Viewer provides detailed high-resolution  maps of exposure and vulnerability to coastal 
hazards with s ea level rise, and thus supports planning at commun ity, county, and state levels. However, 
the Hawaiʻi S ea Level Rise Viewer should  be updated as new climate science and improved sea level rise 
hazard modeling approaches become available.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
15 Sea Level Rise O utlook: Global and Local Observations 
and Projections  
Pua a‘e la ka uwahi o ka moe. The smoke seen in the 
dream now rises. The trouble of which we were 
forewarned is here.  
Located at the center of the North Pacific basin, Hawaiʻi is one of 
the most remote , beautiful, and threatened places on the planet. 
While threats of active volcanoes, tropical storms, hurricanes, 
earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods are a constant reminder to 
islanders of the risks of natural hazards, sea level rise threatens 
to permanentl y reshape Hawaii’s landscape and future. If we 
continue along the current trajectory of GHG  emiss ions in our 
atmosphere, the lon g-term sea level rise outlook for Hawaiʻi and 
the world is grim.  Global observations from tide gauges and 
satellite data show increasing rates of sea level rise over the past 
century  throughout the oceans . The high end “business as usual” 
scenario put forth  by the IPCC , which is  the United Nations  body 
of leading climate scientists , projects up to  3.2 feet of sea level rise 
by the end of the century  (IPCC 2014) . However, t here is a 
growing body of scientific evidence  since  the release of the 2014 IP CC AR5 that accelerated melting of the 
Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets may contribute to more than 3 feet of sea level rise  before the end of 
this century . Scientists in Hawaiʻi and around the world are working to understand how global changes 
impact lo cal conditions. We must keep abreast of the latest science in order to inform our efforts to adapt 
to sea level rise.  
Key Take -Aways  
 Rapid build -up of GHGs , including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, 
due to humans, is causing global warming and climate disruption.  
 Carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is of particular concern because of its effects on 
the global climate system can last for centuries.  
 The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is well outsid e the range of natural 
variability and is now approaching 410 p arts per million, which is about 40%  higher than pre -
industrial levels and the highest in at least last 800,000  years and probably as long as 3 million 
years.  
 Globally -averaged sea level is ris ing at increasing rates due to global warming of the atmosphere 
and oceans.  
 
Call to Action  
“We believe future generations have a 
right to live in a Hawai'i that is safe, 
healthy, and prosperous. We hope that 
Hawai'i will take a leadership role in sea 
level rise adaptation, using sound 
science and active participation and 
empowermen t of the whole community 
with a long -term perspective. By doing 
so, we will have developed effective 
community driven strategies to mitigate 
effects of sea level rise .”

Adaptation Work shop, O ‘ahu 
January 2016  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
16  Global atmosphere and ocean warming is leading to sea level rise that results from the thermal 
expansion of the oceans and melting of land -based ice including glaciers and polar ic e sheets.  
 While the high -end IPCC scenario projects up to 3.2 feet (1 meter) of sea level rise by the year 
2100, more recent studies indicate that over 6  feet of sea level rise is “physically plausible ” by the 
end of the century based on the potential for accelerated melting of the Antarctic and Greenland 
ice sheets.  
 Coastal flooding and erosion hazards from high waves and storms are increasing with sea level 
rise. 
 Computer model projections of tropical cyclone activity and El Niño patterns in the central North 
Pacific indicate increasi ng risk of hurricanes for Hawai‘ i. 
 Ongoing global and local scientific observations and projections continue to improve our 
understanding of the magnitude and timing of these impacts to our islands.  
Observations  
While the Ea rth’s climate has experienced change and 
variability over geologic time, global climate change 
occurring over the last century due to human  input of 
GHG s into th e atmosphere is unprecedented over the 
period of human civilization. This rapid build -up in 
GHG s, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, 
and fluorinated gases,  from humans,  is causing global 
warming and climate disruption.  
While climate science continues to evolve, the 
consensus that humans are causing these changes in 
our climate is shar ed by over 97% of climate scientists 
globally (Cook et al. 2016) . Nearly 200 worldwide 
scientific organizations hold an official position that 
climate change is caused by human activity, including 
diverse groups such as the U.S. National Academy of 
Sciences, American Geophysical Union, American Meteorological Society, American Chem ical Society, 
American Society of Civil Engineers, and American Medical Association (State of California 2011, NASA 
2017c) . Most recently, the U.S, Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), under the administrative 
lead of NOAA, released its 4th National Climate Assessment. As part of th is assessment , a Climate Science 
Special Repor t (CSSR) was prepared as a stand -alone document to report the state of science relating to 
climate change and its physical impacts. The CSSR is designed to be an authoritative assessment of the 
science of climate change, with a focus on the United States, to serve as a foundation for efforts to assess 
climate -related risks and inform decision -making about responses. In this report, the USGCRP concluded 
Climate Change and Variability  
(IPCC 2007)  
Climate change : A change in the state of the climate 
that can be identified (e.g., using statistical tests) by 
changes in the mean and/or the variability of its 
properties that persist for an extended period, 
typically decades or longer.  
Climate variability: The variations in the mean state 
and other statistics (e.g., standard deviations, the 
occurrence of extremes) of the climate on all spatial 
and temporal scales beyond that of individual 
weather events. Examples of climate va riability 
include interannual El Niño and La Niña events that 
occur every two to seven years and influence 
weather patterns over vast regions of the globe.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

warming since the mid -20th century”  (USGCRP 201 7). 
Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide  
Hawai‘i ’s Mauna Loa Observatory is one of the world’s leading scientific stations  for monitoring the 
atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxi de. The plot, often referred to as the Keeling Curve (which was 
named after the a tmospheric chemist), shows the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since 
1958  and is the longest continuous direct measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography 2015)  (Figure 4). These measurements show that the carbon dioxide concentration in the 
atmosphere now exceeds 400 parts per million, about 40% above pre -industrial levels.  About half of the 
man-made carbon dioxide produced since the industrial revolution (Ballantyne et al. 2012)  and about 93% 
of the excess heat caused by GHG warming since the mid -20th century has been absorbed by the world’s 
oceans (Rhein 2013) . While this may have moderated the warming of  the atmosphere, changes to ocean 
chemistry and warming resulting from this uptake of carbon dioxide and heat is resulting in negative impacts 
to marine ecosystems.  
 
Measurements from air bubbles trapped in ice cores taken from the Antarctic and Greenland  ice sheets 
indicate that the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere  has varied between about 180 and 280 parts 
per million over the past 800,000 years with the coming and going of ice ages on an approximately 100,000 -
year cycle (Tripati, Roberts, and Eagle 2009)  (Figure 5). In 2018, atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concent rations will likely exceed 410 parts per million several months out of the year. The only explanation 
for this rapid and unprecedented increase is due to human activity.

Hawai ʻi is doing our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by working toward a 
100% renewable power supply by 2045  
Hawai ʻi established a goal of 100% renewable electric utility sales of power by 2045. The Hawai‘i Public 
Utilities Commission i ssued a landmark “post -net-metering” ruling, ending the State’s net energy metering 
policy for rooftop solar in favor of two (2) new programs called “self-supply ” and “grid-supply. ” “Self -supply” 
is intended for solar installations that are designed to not  export any electricity to the grid and customers are 
not compensated for any export of energy. “Grid -supply” customers receive a PUC -approved credit for 
electricity sent to the grid and are billed at the retail rate for electricity they use from the grid.  More than 
10% of the State’s homes are now powered by solar energy with 16% on O‘ahu.  Further o n December 12, 
2017, Hawaii’s mayors commit ted to 100% renewable ground transportation.  We can all do our part by 
purchasing energy -efficient vehicles and goin g solar on every rooftop!

19 Atmospheric and Ocean Temperatures  
Measurements made by multiple scientific a gencies  around the world over the past century reveal that 
global atmospheric temperature is increasing a nd has been accelerating  since about 1980 (Figure 6). 
Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth ’s average surface temperature over the past 
century primarily due to the GHGs  released as people burn fossil fuels.  These temperature data are 
collected from weather stations, ships, and marine buoys located around the world.  Each of the last three 
decade s has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850 
(IPCC 2014) . Sixteen  of the 17 warmest years in the  span of the  136-year temperature record have all 
occurred since 2001, with the exception of 1998  which s aw one of the most powerful El Niño s on record 
(NASA 2017c) . The y ear 2016 ranks as the warmest on record , seconded by 2015, and then 2014 . While 
shorter -term (inter -annual) variability in global temperature is also visible in the records, there is a clear, 
long-term trend t hat Earth’s climate is getting warmer  (NASA 2016, USGCRP 2017, NASA 2017c) . This 
rising atmospheric temperature also coincides with rising temperatures of the earth’s oceans.  
 
Sea surface temperatures have also in creased during the 20th century and will continue to rise. From 1901 
to 2015, sea surface temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.13 degrees  (°) Fahrenheit per decade 
(Figure 7). Similar to atmospheric temperature, sea surface t emperature has been consistently higher 
during the past three decades. It should be noted, however, that changes in sea surface temperature vary 
regionally.  While most parts of the world’s oceans have seen an increase in temperature, there are a few 
areas that have actually experienced cooling, such as in the North Atlantic ( Figure 8).

21 Global Mean Sea Level  
This w arming of the atmosphere and the oceans is causing global mean sea level to rise. This has been 
observed over the last century in tide station data from around the world and, more recently, in satellite -
based ocean height measurements. The rate of sea level rise has accelerated over the past century ( Figure 
9) (Fasullo, Nerem, and Hamlington 2016)  and global mean sea level has risen by 8 to 9  inches (21  to 24 
centimeters) since 1880, with a third of that rise occurring since 1993 (Church and White 2011, Hay et  al. 
2015, Nerem et al. 2010) . This conicides with a  key finding of  the CSSR (USGCRP 2017)  which found that 
global mean sea level has risen by about 7 to 8 inches (about 16 to 21 cm) since 1900, with about 3 of 
those inches (about 7 cm) occurring since 1993.  
 
Global mean sea level  is rising from two p rimary contributions;  thermal expansion of ocean waters and 
melting of land-based glaciers and ice sheets  (Church 2013) . Heating of the ocean surface cau ses the 
water to expand  while the m elting of the glaciers and ice sheets  from continents (i.e. Greenland and 
Antarctica)  transfer water mass from the continents  to the ocean also causing  the ocean to rise. Up to the 
early 2000s, expansion and ice melt cont ributed similar amounts of water , however, ice mel t now 
contribute s about twice the amount than that of thermal expansion ( Figure 10). The global loss of glaciers 
in the 21st century is unprecedented  (Zemp et al. 2015) . Multiple data sets and models were used in a 
recent reassessment of the mass balance of Earth’s polar ice sheets (Shepherd et al. 2012) . The melting 
of Greenland and Antarctic glaciers and ice sheets  alone is estimated to contribute approximately 34% of 
the rise in sea level  globally.  Between 2002 and 201 6, the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica 
decreased in volume contributing , on average , 0.05 inches ( 1.15 millim eters ) per year to the rate of global 
sea level rise  (NASA 2017a)  (Figure 11). Glaciers and ice sheets have contributed approximately 0.06 
inches (1.63 millimeters) per year t o the rate of sea level rise in Hawaiʻi (NASA 2017b) . 
  
Figure 9. Observed global mean sea level rise over the last century (Church 
and White 2011, Nerem et al. 2010, Yi et al. 2015, Hay et al. 2015, Hansen et 
al. 2016, Watson et al. 2015, Fasullo, Nerem, and Hamlington 2016)  
The rate of globally -
averaged sea level rise 
is increasing. This 
acceleration is 
expected to con tinue 
due to accelerating 
melting of the 
Greenland and 
Antarctic glaciers and 
ice sheets

As global atmosphere and 
ocean temperatures rise, sea 
level also rises due to 
thermal expansion of the 
water and melting of glaciers 
and ice sheets.

glacier and ice sheet melting to sea level rise (Thompson et al. 2017)   Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
23 Long -term records from tide sta tions around Hawaiʻi show that sea level is rising around the islands ( Figure 
12). However, it should be noted that local relative rates of sea level rise vary among the islands due to 
varying rates of subsidence a long the volcanic island chain and possibly, in part, due to oceanic variability. 
The relative rate of sea level rise on the Island of  Hawai‘i is almost twice the rate on the Island of  Kauaʻi 
(NOAA 2017c) . This is due to the fact that the Island of  Hawai‘i is slowly subsiding as it gains mass from 
active volcanoes resulting in a higher relative rate of sea level rise ( Figure 12) while the islands of Kauaʻi 
and Oʻahu, which are the older islands in the chain, are relatively stable.  
 
Figure 12. Observed mean  sea level trends and rates of sea level rise in the Hawaiian Islands (NOAA 2017c)  
It has been observed that sea level rise resulting from global warming exacerbates temporary high sea 
level events caused by natural climate and oc eanic variability in the Pacific Ocean related to: (1) transiting 
elevated water masses called “mesoscale eddies”, (2) El Niño events, (3) longer term (multi -decade) 
fluctuations called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and (4) wind stress. This natur al variability is 
visible in the blue monthly mean sea level lines shown in Figure 12 and can result in fluctuations of 6  inches 
or more from the long -term average trend (Marra, Merrifield, and Sweet 2012, NOAA 2014) . Sea level rise  
has also caused an increase in “sunny day” or tidal  flooding. Tidal f looding occur s when tides are 
exceptionally high  in combination with high waves and /or other oceanic and atmospher ic phenomena  
(Moftakhari et al. 2017) . Tidal flooding can have major impacts such as road overwash  and backed -up 
storm drains  in low -lying areas . On the Island of  O‘ahu, the city of Honolulu experienced the greatest 
number of tidal flooding days in 2002 and 2003 , as illustrated in Figure 13 compared to 35 days in 2016 
(Marra et al. 2017) .

24 Tidal  flooding is becoming increasingly common along low-lying shorelines  throughout the world  even in 
the absence of storm effects  (Sweet et al. 2014) . This coincides with a key finding of the recently released 
CSSR  (USGCRP 2017)  which projects that tidal flooding will continue increasing in depth, frequency, and 
extent this century  based on observations of  several U.S. coastal cit ies in which the number of tidal floods 
each year h as increased 5 - to 10 -fold since the 1960s due to sea level rise .

  TIDAL FLOODING 2017 – A GLIMPSE INTO OUR NEAR FUTURE  
Elevated water levels in spring and summer of 2017 provided a glimpse of our near future when 
coastal flooding events will occur more frequently and severely with continued sea level rise. The 
University of Hawaiʻi Sea Level Center found th at the 2017 anomalous ly high  water levels resulted 
from an unprecedented combination of Pacific -wide climate and ocean variability, ocean eddies with 
elevated centers moving through the islands, and global sea level rise on top of  “king tides ” (the 
highest  astronomical tides of the year).  This extraordinary combination resulted in record -high water 
levels on the Honolulu tide gauge and caused localized flooding and coastal erosion throughout the 
islands in the spring and summer of 2017. Impacts included bea ch overwash and erosion at Waikīkī 
and flooding of roads and businesses in the Mapunapuna area of Oʻahu. “Citizen scientists” helped 
document flooding impacts around the islands as part of  the University of Hawaiʻi Sea Grant 
program’s Hawai‘i and Pacific I slands King Tides Project , which utilizes a free publicly available  
mobile application  and photo database. The program and images collected are helping decision -
makers and the public to better understand and visualize Hawai ‘i’s vulnerability to sea level r ise as 
well as enabling researchers to validate models of sea level rise and flooding impacts. For m ore

26 Modified Trade Winds (El Niño Events)  
The east to west trade winds play a large role in the climate of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These winds 
can vary in response to El Niño Southern Oscillation  (ENSO) and PDO  phases. During El Niño events, the 
relaxation of the trade winds causes water levels to rise in the eastern tropical Pacific. During La Niña 
events, enhanced trade winds “drive” water near the equa tor to the west resulting in lower sea levels in the 
eastern Pacific . El Niño  events in the tropical Pacific can cause sea levels to rise 6 to 12 inches above 
mean conditions  in some areas  (Marra, Merrifield, and Sweet 2012) . 
Tropical Cyclones  
Tropical cyclones are weather events generated in tropical latitudes characterized by very heavy rainfall 
and strong and damaging winds that can generate storm surge and extremely high waves.  A good example 
of this is Hurricane Iniki , which hit the Island of  Kauai as a C ategory 4  hurricane  on September 11, 1992 
causin g almost $2 billion in damage . In 2015 (an El Niño year), t he Central Pacific saw a historic number 
of tropical cyclones, with 15  named storms  (Figure 14), 8 hurricanes, and 5 major hur ricanes , making 2015 
the most active season since reliable record -keeping began in 197 0 (NOAA National Centers for 
Environmental Information 2016) . The tropical cyclone activity, heavily influenced by a strong El Niño and 
widespread ocean  warming  across the central Pacific bas in, started in early July and continued non-stop 
through October.  Three Category 4  hurricanes , Ignacio, Kil o and Jimena , lined up across the Central and 
Eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29, 2015. On Sunday, August 30, from west to east,  Hurricane Kilo was 
located 1,20 0 miles west -southwest of Honolulu, Hawaiʻi , Hurricane Ignacio was located 515 miles east -
southeast of Hilo,  Hawaiʻi , and Hurricane Jimena was located 1,815 miles east -southeast of Hilo, Hawaiʻi . 
Although none of them made landfall, this was the first time th is level of hurricane activity ha d been 
observed ( Figure 15). There were direct impacts to Johnston Island and portions of the Northwest ern 
Hawaiian Islands  (NWHI) , and caused  the evacuation of research staff on Kamole or Laysan  Island .

The number of tropical 
cyclones in the central 
Pacific is highly 
variable from year to 
year. More tropical 
cyclone activity is 
generally correlated 
with El Niño events. A 
doubling of El Niño 
events is projected in  
response to 
greenhouse warming  
(Cai et al. 2014) .

28 Projections  
Projections of global and local sea level rise are critical for adapting to climate change. The IPCC 
projections, based on a synthesis of the published literature, represent the scientific consensus on climat e 
change. The IPCC climate and sea level forecasts represent  the inputs and analyse s of thousands of 
scientists  and a broad consensus of an international group of authors and reviewers. The IPCC AR5 
provides projections of global mean sea level rise for fo ur GHG emissions scenarios  (IPCC 2014) .These 
scenarios are called representative concentration pathways (RCP s).  
The RCPs describe possible climate futures based on how much GHG s are emitte d. The four scenarios, 
RCP2.6,  RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the 
year 2100 relative to pre -industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 watts per square meter ). A radiative 
forcing is a change in  the balance of incoming and outgoing energy  in the Earth -atmosphere system. Sea 
level rise projections for the high GHG emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and the low GHG emissions scenario 
(RCP2.6) are shown in Figure 16. 
 
 
 
Figure 16. Projected rate of global mean sea level rise under different 
GHG scenarios (IPCC 2014)  
The upper boundary of this 
IPCC scenario (RCP8.5) 
was used in modeling 
coastal hazards with sea 
level rise in this Report. 
This upper boundary of the 
business -as-usual 
scenario of 3.2 feet is the 
likely scenario because ice 
sheets and glaciers are 
melting at rates greater 
than accounted for in the 
IPCC report (NASA 2015) .  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
29 On the high end, “business as usual” scenario, RCP8 .5 assumes that no reduction in GHGs will occur over 
the period modeled (Figure 16). Uncertainty of the projections increases with time as indicated by the 
increasing width of the projection after the year 2050. Th e RCP8.5 scenario was used in the Report to 
model exposure to sea level rise at 0. 5 feet in 2030, 1. 1 feet in 2050, 2.0 feet in 2075, and 3.2 feet in 2100. 
The decision to use the upper limit of the IPCC projections was initially made out of  precaution —to assess 
what is potentially  vulnerable to sea level rise. Climate science and sea level rise projections have co ntinued 
to evolve since the IPCC AR5 and throughout the development of this Report. S ea level observations and 
trend s in the latest scien tific literature suggest that 1.1  feet of sea level rise could be reached intermittently 
in Hawaiʻi ov er the next couple of decades and  sustained before mid -century. Local projections of sea level 
rise for Honolulu using the IPCC model but incorporating regional a nd local factors that influence sea level, 
suggest a slightly higher range of mean sea level rise of 2.0 feet (0.6 meters) to 3.6 feet (1.1 meters) in 
2100 using the RCP 8.5 scenario (Kopp et al. 2014) .  
The recently released CSSR  (USGCRP 2017)  reports  that relative  to the year 2000, global mean sea leve l 
is very likely to rise 0.3 to 0.6 feet (9 to 18 cm) by 2030, 0.5 to 1.2 feet (15 to 38 cm) by 2050, a nd 1.0 to 
4.3 feet (30 to 130 cm) by 2100 with very high confidence in lower bounds; medium confidence in upper 
bounds for 2030 and 2050;  and low conf idence in upper bounds for 2100 . Future pathways have little effect 
on projected global me an sea level rise in the first half of the century, but significantly affect projections for 
the second half of the century (high confidence). Emerging science regarding Antarctic ice sheet stability 
suggests that, for high emission scenarios, a global mea n sea level rise exceeding 7.9 feet (2.4 m) by 2100 
is” physically plausible” , although the probability of such an extreme outcome cannot currently be assessed. 
Regardless of pathway, it is extremely likely that global mean sea level rise will continue bey ond 2100 (high 
confidence).  
The IPCC is currently working toward its 6th Assessment Report (AR6) which will be finalized in 2021; 
although a special report on climate change and the oceans and the cryosphere is expected to be released 
by the IPCC before th e next assessment report . In the meantime, new scientific research continues to 
emerge providing insights into climate change and sea level rise. Antarctica , alone,  has the potential to 
contribute more than  3.0 feet (1 .0 meter)  of sea  level rise by 2100 if  emissions continue unabated  (Figure 
11). Atmospheric warming will  become t he dominant driver of ice loss but prolonged ocean warming will 
delay recovery of ice sheets and glaciers for thousands of years (DeConto and Pollard 2016) .  
According to a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA ) report (Sweet et al. 2017) 
looking at the most up -to-date scientific literature on sea level rise projections, g lobal mean sea level rise 
in the range of 6.4 feet (2.0 m eters ) to 8.8 feet (2.7 m eters ) is “physically p lausible ” by the end of this century 
(Sweet et al. 2017) , which is much  higher than the worst case IPCC AR5 projections shown in Figure 16. 
These high-end projections are based on  observations and models of potential rapid ice melt in Greenland 
and Antarctica.  Further, t he NOAA 2017 r eport  indicate s that sea level rise in the area around Hawaiʻi and 
other “far -field” areas in the tropical oceans will exceed projections of global mean sea level rise due to 
mass and gravitational changes with the melting of the  Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets ( Figure 17) 
(Sweet et al. 2017) .  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

Figure 17. Ratio of projected relative sea level rise to global mean sea level rise attributed to mass loss from 
specific land -ice sources. Values more than 1  indicate areas with projected relative sea level rise greater than 
the global averag e sea level rise (Sweet et al. 2017)  
 
The recently released CSSR  (USGCRP 2017)  states that a ssuming storm characteristics do not change, 
sea level rise will increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, 
such as hurricanes . In addition to global sea level rise, gl obal projections of tropical cyclone  activity indicate  
an increase in average cyclone intensity, precipitation rates, and in the overall number and occurrence -
days of very intense category 4 -5 storms  (Knutson et al. 2015) . Further, projections depict a global average 
migration of tro pical cyclone activity away from the tropics at a rate of about one degree of latitude per 
decade (Kossin, Emanuel, and Vecchi 2014)  and increased frequency of occurrence of tropical cyclones  in 
the Central Pacific (Murakami et al. 2013) . Waves and s torm surge from nearby tropical cyclones and swell

“Given what we know now about how the ocean expands as it warms and how ice sheets and glaciers are 
adding water to the seas, it’s pretty certain we are locked into at least 3.0 feet [0.9 meters] of sea level rise 
and proba bly more. ” (NASA 2015)  
“Humanity faces near certainty of eventual sea level r ise of 16.4 to 29.5 feet (5.0 to 9.0 meters) if fossil fuel 
emissions continue on a business -as-usual course.” (Hansen et a l. 2015)

31 from more distant cyclones would also be expected to increase coastal flooding and erosion which would 
be further worsened by sea level rise. A doubling of the occurrence of El Niñ o events i s also projecte d (Cai 
et al. 2014)  which can sustain more tropical cyclone activity and corresponding wave action, fl ooding, and 
erosion.  
 
Learning Questions for the 5 -Year Report Update  
Learning questions for this chapter are driven by the understanding that climate science is evolving and 
sea level rise projections will be updated. New sea level rise projections inc orporating the latest climate 
science will be available in the in the IPCC A6 report due in 2021. Th is assessment and future National 
Climate Assessments should serve as milestones for the evaluation of sea level rise projections for Hawaiʻi.  
Learning que stions that should be considered for the 5 -year report update include:  
1. What are the observations of change in sea level in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands, and how 
do the y correspond with the recent global acceleration in mean sea level rise? 
2. To what extent has the magnitude and timing of  the sea level rise projections from IPCC AR5 
changed with new projections from the IPCC AR6?  
3. What are the observations and projections of the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and 
El Niño events and their e ffects on coastal water levels and tidal flooding?   
 
 
Rising sea level and projections of stronger and more 
frequent El Niño events and tropical cyclones in waters 
surrounding Hawai‘i, all indicate a growing 
vulnerability to coastal flooding and erosion. While the 
IPCC’s business -as-usual scenario  predicts up to 3.2 
feet of global sea level rise by 2100, recent 
observations and projections suggest that this 
magnitude of sea level rise could occur as early as year 
2060 (Sweet et al. 2017) . For this reason, it is vital that 
we track the magnitude and rate of sea level rise as 
new projections emerge, plan for 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise now , and be ready to adjust that projection 
upward. It is also important to recogni ze that global 
sea level rise does not stop at 2100 but will very likely 
continue for centuries.

E nānā ana i ka ‘ōpua o ka ‘āina.  Observing the 
horizon clouds of the land. Seeking to discover future 
events by observing the cloud omens.   
Our understanding of Hawaii’s vulnerability to co astal hazards has 
largely been grounded in observations of the past.  In a changing 
climate, projections of future conditions must be combined with 
historical trends to assess the social, cultural, economic, and 
environmental vulnerabilities to sea level ri se. Modeling, using the 
best available science and methods, was conducted to determine 
the potential future exposure of each island to multiple coastal 
hazards as a result of sea level rise.  Using the outputs of this coastal 
hazard modeling, vulnerability was assessed to provide information 
and data needed to support efforts to encourage Hawaii’s 
adaptation to sea level rise.  
Key Take -Aways  
 Exposure to multiple coastal hazards was modeled using the best available historical data and 
projections of sea level  rise derived from the upper boundaries of the IPCC ’s AR5  “business -as-
usual ”, RCP8.5 scenario.  
 Previous studies of sea level rise hazard exposure for Hawai‘i and elsewhere have typically relied 
on “bathtub” models of passive flooding with sea level rise ( e.g., raising static water levels over 
digital topographic maps), which does not account for the effects of more landward seasonal 
wave inundation and higher erosion rates along our coasts due to rising seas.  
 A more thorough assessment of sea level rise  impacts and hazard exposure was produced in this 
study by modeling three types of hazards: passive flooding, annual high wave flooding (average 
annual high wave over -wash at the shoreline),  and coastal erosion (shoreline re cession  and land 
loss).  
 Chronic fl ooding with sea level rise is depicted as the SLR -XA based on the combined outputs of 
modeling passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion.  
 Data on the social, economic, and environmental valued assets that were used in the vulnerabili ty 
assessment were obtained from existing federal, state, and county databases.  
 Vulnerability to sea level rise was assessed in terms of the potential impacts to people, 
structures, land, infrastructure, beaches, cultural resources, and other assets vulner able to sea 
 
Call to Action  
“Sea level rise will force us to address 
existing and prevent future private 
development along shorelines. Multiple 
planning and regulatory strategies are 
needed to both incentivize and 
criminally discourage reckless, 
unfettered coastal development over 
short and long terms. These strategies 
will result in reduction in environment, 
property and human losses, possible 
gains in public spaces, and better usage 
of public funds.”

 Vulnerability to chronic flooding in the SLR -XA (e.g., the combined effects of high wave flooding,

Coastal Hazards Modeling with Sea Level Rise  
Hawaiʻi experiences coa stal flooding and erosion due to high waves and tides, and infrequent events such 
as storm surges and tsunamis ( Figure 18). With higher sea level, waves and tides will reach farther inland 
and with greater velocity  resulting in increased coastal erosion, flooding, and overall damage to coastal 
communities. Previous studies of sea level rise hazard exposure for Hawaiʻi and elsewhere typically rely 
on “bathtub” models to estimate passive flooding with sea level rise (NOAA 2017b) . The bathtub model 
provides a good first look at sea level rise ha zards by identifying low -lying coastal areas and employing a 
static digital elevation model (DEM) to raise water levels over existing topography. However, the model 
does not account for potentially significant damage from higher sea level rise when annual (e.g., typical 
seasonal wave set -up) high waves, erosion, and storms are added to the model mix. To provide a more 
thorough assessment of sea level rise hazard exposure and vulnerability, this study assesses three types 
of hazards: passive flooding, annual  high wave flooding (average annual high wave over -wash at the 
shoreline), and coastal erosion (shoreline recession and land loss).

34 Coastal hazards modeling was conducted by two teams: The Coastal Geology Group at UH SOEST who 
modeled (1) passive groundwater, drainage, and marine flooding, (2) coastal erosion, and (3) annual high 
wave flooding with sea level rise ( Table 1) and Tetra Tech who deve loped the combined exposure to these 
three hazards referred to as the SLR -XA. Not all hazards were modeled for each island due to limited 
historical information and geospatial (map) data ( Table 1). As such, the SLR -XA for the islands of Moloka‘i, 
Lāna‘i, and Hawaiʻi are based on modeling for passive flooding only.

Global Sea Level Rise Projections  
Coastal hazards were modeled using the IPCC global sea level rise projections. The IPCC AR5 ide ntified 
four sea level rise scenar ios based on RCPs  (IPCC 2014) . The “business -as-usual” scenario, RCP8.5, was 
used in coastal hazard modeling for this Report. For passive flooding and annual high wave flooding, the 
upper boundary of the RCP8.5 sc enario was used to model coastal hazards in the fut ure (Table 2; see al so 
Figure 16). In mo deling coastal erosion, the uncertainty (upper and lower bounds) of the RCP8.5 se a level 
rise projection was use d (Figure 16).  
Assumptions and Limitations.  The IPCC AR5 “business -as-usual” GHG emissions scenario, RCP8.5, 
which predicts as much as 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the year 2100, wa s used as the basis of our modeling 
effort. For the Report, the decision to use the upper limit of the IPCC projections was initially made “out of 
an abundance of precaution.” Since the release of  the IPCC AR5, leading climate scientists and 
organizations,  such as NOAA, are reporting that higher scenarios of sea level rise in this century are more 
likely than previously thought primarily due to improving understanding of the Antarctic and Greenland ice 
sheet instability (see discussion in previous SLR Outlo ok chapter). As note d throughout this Report, climate 
science and sea level rise projections have continued to evolve since the IPCC AR5 report and will continue 
to do so after this Report is completed.

Passive Flooding  
Passive flooding, also known as hydrostatic flooding, is depicted by bathtub modeling. Passive flooding 
includes  marine flooding over the shoreline by stillwater flow into the lands that lie below the water level. It 
also depicts low -lying areas indirectly flooded by sea level rise through water table rise. Passive flooding is 
exacerbated by rainfall as it prevents drainage and as such, runoff and marine waters combine to produce 
larger impacts. Passive flooding was modeled by UH SOEST using a modified "bathtub" approach that 
accounts for both regional tidal variability and hydrological connectivity (Cooper et al. 2013) . Passive 
flooding represents the simplest projection and provides an initial assessment  of low -lying areas susceptible 
to flooding by sea level rise.  Passive flooding includes areas that are hydrologically connected to the ocean 
(marine flooding) and low -lying areas that are not hydrologically connected to the ocean (groundwater) 
(Figure 19).

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
36 Data Inputs.  Data used in modeling passive flooding included the global sea level rise projections 
discussed above, DEM s, and the mean higher high water (MHHW) datum. A DEM is a three -dimensional  
(3D) representation of a terrain surface. DEMs are derived from aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) 
data. DEMs used in this study are freely available from NOAA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE) and include nearshore bathymetry.  
Hazard m odeling for passive flooding used DEMs with either 1 -meter (i.e.1x1 meter) or 3 -meter grid cells 
in order to capture the full extent of flooding for 3.2 feet of sea level rise for all islands ( Figure 20). The 1 -
meter resolution DEM was compiled by the Coastal Geology Group at UH SOEST and derived from USACE 
2013, 1999 -2003Topo/Bathy LiDAR data surveys and UH SOEST multi -beam and side -scan sonar data. 
This dataset includes both terrain and bathymetric LiDAR returns. The horizontal positional (locational) 
accuracy root mean square error at the 95% confidence interval (RMSE 95%) of the DEM is better than 1.0 
meter while the vertical positional accuracy is 0.09 meters (9 centimeters) for the terrain LiDAR, 0.125 
meters ( 12.5 centimeters) for shallow bathymetric returns, and 0.20 meters (20 centimeters) for deeper 
water returns. The NOAA 3 -meter DEM incorporates LiDAR data sets collected between 2003 and 2007 
from NOAA, FEMA, the State of Hawaiʻi Emergency Management Agenc y, and the USACE (NOAA National 
Centers for Environmental Information 2017) . The high -resolution DEM (1 -meter), which covers terrain near 
the shoreline, was combined with the l ower -resolution DEM (3 -meter), which covers more inland terrain, to 
expand the overall coverage of the DEM for modeling passive flooding. All DEMs were processed using a 
smoothing algorithm to remove buildings, trees, and other features to create a “bare -earth” topographic 
surface.   
The horizontal and vertical positional accuracies of the DEMs conform to FEMA flood hazard mapping 
standards (FEMA 2012) . Those standards specify a maximum horizontal (location) accuracy of 3.3 feet (1.0 
meter) and a vertical (elevation) accuracy of no more than 1.0 feet (0.3 meters) based on the RMSE 95%. 
The DEMs used in this study were adjusted ver tically from ellipsoid heights to match a local tidal datum 
based on local mean sea level using a single offset value calculated by NOAA and derived from tidal 
benchmarks for each island (NOAA 2017a) . 
The MHHW datum was used as a reference (base -level) height for modeling sea level rise. The MHHW 
datum is the average of the higher high water height of each tidal day observed over the National T idal 
Datum Epoch (1983 to 2001).  
Modeling Approach.  Passive flooding was modeled using the DEMs in GIS software to identify areas 
below a certain sea level height ( flooded  by sea level rise) when raising water level s above current MHHW 
tidal datum . Water l evels are shown as they would appear during MHHW, or the average higher high water 
height of each tidal day (NOAA 2013) . The area flooded was  derived by subtracting a tidal surface model 
from the DEM.  For more information on the methods employed refer to Cooper et al. (2012)  and Cooper et 
al. (2013) . For quality control, modeled flooded areas were compared against known elevations.  Example 
maps of modeled passive flooding for Punalu‘u , O‘ahu with 1.1 and 3.2 feet of sea level rise are provided 
in Figure 21.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

39 Assumptions and Limitations.  In many areas around the State, represent ing sea level rise from passive 
marine flooding will likely produce an underestimate of the area inundated or permanently submerged 
because the model does not account for waves and coastal erosion, important proce sses a long Hawaii’s 
highly dynamic coasts that increase the extent of potential hazards  and damages  along our shores. For this 
reason, coastal erosion and annual high wave flooding are also modeled to provide a more comprehensive 
picture of the extent of hazard exposure with sea level rise in Ha waiʻi.    
The passive flooding model does not explicitly include flooding through storm drain systems and other 
underground infrastructure, which will contribute to flooding in many low -lying areas identified in the model. 
The DEMs used in modeling depict a  smoothed topographic surface and do not identify basements, parking 
garages, and other development below ground that will be affected by marine and groundwater flooding 
with sea level rise. As with the other models in this Report, the passive flooding mod el is intended to provide 
an initial screening tool for sea level rise vulnerability. More detailed hydrologic and engineering modelling 
may be necessary to fully assess passive marine flooding hazards at the scale of individual properties.

40 Annual Hig h Wave Flooding  
The distance over which waves run -up and wash across the shoreline will increase with sea level rise. As 
water levels increase, less wave energy will be dissipated through breaking on nearshore reefs and waves 
will arrive at a higher elevat ion at the shoreline. Hawaiʻi is exposed to large waves annually on all open 
coasts due to our location in the Central North Pacific Ocean . High wave events generated by distant and 
localized storms, combined with extreme high tides , frequently cause damag ing overwash and flooding. 
High waves arrive at Hawaii’s shores from four primary sources: swell from North Pacific storms in winter 
months, swell from distant southern hemisphere storms in summer months, easterly trade wind waves year 
round, and infrequen t southerly “Kona” storm waves, found typically during the winter months  (Figure 22) 
(Vitousek and Fletcher 2008) . Key inputs and outputs of modeling annual high wave flooding  are illustrated 
in Figure 23.

Figure 23. Schematic diagram of showing key inputs and outputs of modeling annual high wave flooding  
Data In puts. Historical data used to model annual high wave flooding consisted of modeled hourly 
measurements  of significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak wave direction, acquired from 
offshore wave buoy data from  the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing Sys tem (PacIOOS ) (PacIOOS 2017) . 
Offshore w aves for  coasts around  Oʻahu, Kauaʻi, and Maui islands  were modeled from the buoy data by 
PacIOOS beginning June 2010, using the Simulated W Aves Nearshore (SWAN) model developed by 
researchers at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands (SWAN 2017) . The incoming wave 
conditions used at the outer geographic boundaries  for the regional SWAN models were provided by the 
WaveWatch III model, as developed by NOAA (NOAA 2016c) . Modeled SWAN estimates were preferred 
over wave buoy records because the model provides nearshore wave parameters for all locations at rough ly 
500-meter resolution, which also incorporates the effects of nearshore coastal dynamics such as refraction, 
shoaling, and island shadowing.  
The maximum annually recurring wave parameters (significant wave height, peak wave period, and peak 
wave directio n) from the historical modeled wave record were used to model annual high wave flooding 
exposure. Maximum wave parameters were determined at offshore locations spaced roughly 1.5 kilometers 
apart along the coast and in about 20 to 35 meters of water depth.  At each location, the maximum annually 
recurring significant wave height was determined by performing a generalized extreme value (GEV) 
analysis on the historical wave record, following the method presented in Vitousek and  Fletcher (2008) . 
  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
42 Annual peak wave periods are the median of all wave periods corresponding to extreme wave heights 
within one standard deviation of the annual maximum significant wave height  from the GEV analysis . To 
determine the annual peak wave dire ction, the above procedure was repeated on subsets of historical wave 
heights, where each subset only included waves that approached from a prescribed 30° directional window 
with 15° overlap between windows.  For example, one subset contained only waves who se hourly peak 
directions were between 0 -30°N, while another window contained waves whose hourly peak directions were 
between 15 -45°N.  
The maximum peak direction was defined as the center of the directional window with the largest significant 
wave height a nd peak wave period, which typically coincided with waves arriving parallel  to the shore.  On 
occasion, the largest significant wave height and peak wave period were not in the same directional window; 
in these circumstances, expert elicitation was used to determine the appropriate window.  
Hazard modeling for annual high wave flooding used the higher resolution, but narrower landward -extent, 
1-meter DEM.  
Modeling Approach.  Annual high wave flood  modeling  was conducted only for Maui, O‘ahu, and Kaua‘i 
and di d not cover all shorelines ( Figure 24). Computer model simulations of future annual high wave 
flooding were conducted by UH SOEST using the  XBeach  (for eXtreme Beach behavior) numerical model  
developed by a consortium of research institutions (Deltares 2017) . Key inputs and outp uts of the model 
are shown in a simplified schematic diagram in Figure 23. The model propagates the maximum annually 
recurring wave  from roughly 15 to 35 meter water depth, over the reef, and to the shore, along one-
dimensional (1D) cross -shore profiles  extracted from a 1 -meter DEM . Profiles are spaced 20 meters apart 
along the coast.  This approach was used to model  the transformation of the wave as it breaks across the 
reef and includes shallow water wave processes  such as wave set -up and overtopping.   
Maximum surface elevation and depth of the annual high wave flooding is calculated from the mean of the 
five highest modeled water elevations at each model location along each profile.  Output from the 
simulations is i nterpolated between transects  and compiled in a 5 -meter map grid . Depth grid cells with 
values less than 10 centimeters are not included in the impact assessment.  This was done to remove very 
thin layers of water excursions that (1) are beyond the accuracy  of the model and (2) might not constitute 
a significant impact to land and resources when only occurring once annually. Any low -lying flooded areas 
that are not connected to the ocean are also removed.  Example maps of modeled high annual high wave 
floodin g for 1.1 and 3.2 feet of sea level rise are shown in Figure 25.

45 Assumptions and Limitations.  The historical wave parameters used to model annual high wave flooding 
do not include poss ible changes to future wave characteristics related to climate change. The historical 
wave records used in this study only extend back to the year 2010; annual wave statistics would be 
improved with a longer time series of wave data. However, tests (using data from a wave buoy) that 
compared annual wave statistics over a 30 -year time span with annual wave statistics over several 
truncated, 6 -year time spans showed that the significant wave heights differed by only about 5%.  
Annual high wave flood  modeling  did not cover all shorelines ( Figure 24). The maximum annual ly recurring 
wave parameters  (significant wave height, period, direction) were statistically determined using historical 
wave climate records and do not in clude potential changes in future wave climate or the effects of storm 
surge. In addition, in some cases the extent of the 1 -meter DEM limited the extent of flooding modeled as 
is reflected in a straight edge of landward results from 3.2 feet of sea level rise in Figure 25. The maximum 
annual wave heights (and periods) do not account for less -frequently occurring wave events that can take 
place in any given year. For example, a 1 -in-10 year wave event would not be i ncluded in this wave 
modeling.  
Changes in shoreline location due to coastal erosion are not included in this modeling. As shown in 
Anderson et al. (2015)  and this Report,  the vast majority of beaches are expected to undergo increasing 
erosion and shoreline retre at with increasing sea level rise. As shorelines retreat, annual high wave flooding 
will reach farther inland along retreating shorelines. Waves are propagated along a “bare earth” DEM which 
is void of shoreline structures, buildings, and vegetation, and t herefore depicts the potential of wave 
flooding. Waves are assumed to flow over an impermeable surface. The DEM represents a land surface at 
one particular time, and may not be representative of the beach shape during the season of most severe 
wave impact,  particularly for highly variable north and west -exposed beaches.  
The 1D wave modeling used  in this study will be less accurate in areas where the reef shape and depth is 
highly variable along the coast . Two-dimensional (2D) models that account for alongsh ore movement in 
waves and run -up are available , but require extensive manpower to set up, long computer processing times, 
and are less tested . Harbors and other unexposed coasts (e.g. , Kāne‘ohe Bay) are generally not modeled 
because the 1D model cannot acc ount for circulation patterns and surges that would require 2D modeling . 
Undesirable artifacts of 1D modeling also include over -predicted flooding along transects with deep, shore -
perpendicular indentations in the sea bottom such as nearshore reef  channels . The 1D modeling does not 
account for the presence of nearby  shallow reef which refracts and dissipates  some of the wave energy 
traveling through the channel toward  the shore . Benthic habitat (reef) maps of Hawaiʻi  were used to estimate 
bottom roughness (BAE Systems Sensor Solutions Identification & Surveillance 2007) . However, t he wave 
flooding model may be improved in future efforts through  local field experiments to validate  effects  of bottom  
roughness on water flow across the reef .  
  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
46 Coastal Erosion  
Studies of historical shoreline change using aerial photographs and survey maps show that 70% of beaches 
on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui  shoreline  are eroding (receding landward) (Fletcher et al. 2012) . Sea level rise 
has been shown to be an important driver in the  predominant  trend of coastal erosion around the Hawaiian 
Islands (Romine et al. 2013) . Anderson et al. (2015)  found that shoreline recession (erosion) along Hawaii’s 
beaches will double by mid -century under rising sea level, compared to historical extrapolations.   
Beaches exist in a delicate  balance between existing water levels, wave energy, and sand supply. A small 
rise in sea level can lead to the loss o f a much larger amount of land. Observational and theoretical studies 
of beach response to sea level rise show that beaches recede by a fa ctor of 10 to 100 times the rise in sea 
level height as the beach slope re -equilibrates to a new water level (Zhang, Douglas, and Leatherman 2004, 
Leatherman, Zhang, and Douglas 2000, Bruun 1962) . The modeling used  to simulate the impact of sea 
level rise on coastal erosion is shown schematically in Figure 26. 
 
 
Figure 26. Schematic diagram of showing key inputs and outputs of modeling coastal erosi on (a) and the 
change in shoreline profiles with sea level rise (b)  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
47 Data Inputs.  Historical data used to model coastal erosion consisted of: (1) historical shoreline positions  
and erosion rates  measured  from high -resolution (0.5 meters) ortho -rectified aer ial photographs and NOAA 
topographic charts dating back to the early 1900s  (Fletcher et al. 2012, Romine et al. 2013) , and (2) beach 
profile field surveys data collected between 1994 and 2008 by UH, initially for the U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS) (Gibbs et al. 2001, Fletcher et al. 2012) . The vegetation line was identified in the most recent aerial 
photog raphy dating from 2006 to 2008.   
Modeling Approach. Coastal erosion modeling was conducted for sandy shorelines of Maui, Kaua ‘i, and 
O‘ahu (Figure 27). Modeling was conducted by UH SOEST by combining historical sho reline change trends 
with the Davidson -Arnott profile model of beach response to sea level rise (Davidson -Arnott 2005)  in order 
to estimate probabilities of future exposure to erosion at transects (shore -perpendicular measurement 
locations) spaced approximately 20 meters apart along the shoreline (Anderson et al. 2015) . Coastal 
erosion modeling was not conducted for the islands of Moloka ‘i, Lāna‘i , and Hawaiʻi due to the lack of 
historical  erosion  data ( Figure 26). 
While Hawai ‘i has an overall trend of beach erosion, shoreline trends are highly variable at the scale of 
individual beaches.  It is not un common to find a long -term trend of erosion in one section of beach with 
accretion (beach growth) in an adjoining area due to localized waves and sand transport . The model from 
Anderson et al. (2015)  accounts for localized alongshore variability in shoreline chang e by incorporating 
trends from historical erosion mapping studies.  
The output of the modeling is the e stimated exposure zone to future erosion hazards . The exposure zones  
extend landward from the current -day shoreline  (vegetation line) up to the  80% cumula tive probability  
contour  for each of the four sea level rise  scenarios . Based on the model and sea level rise scenario, there 
is an 80% probability that land that will be impacted by erosion will be confined within the exposure zone at 
that particular time . Example maps of flooding due to coastal erosion with 1.1 and 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
are shown in Figure 28.

50 Assumptions and Limitations.  Historical beach erosion rates do not consider potential changes in 
sediment supply. Sediment supply is influenced by changes in coastal processes and human impacts from 
shoreline hardening and other coastal engineering. The decline of coral reefs from ocean warming, 
acidification, and other impacts al so has potential to affect coastal processes and sediment supply.  
Historical beach profiles needed to model coastal erosion were available for the islands of Kaua ‘i, O‘ahu, 
and Maui. F uture coastal erosion was modeled where historical shoreline measuremen ts were available on 
sandy shorelines (Figure 27). Exposure was not modeled for less -erodible rocky coasts and bluffs, though 
the latter can be prone to sudden failure in some areas. In addition, modeling did not  account for:  
 Existing seawalls or other coastal armoring in the backshore;  
 Increasing wave energy across the fringing reef with sea level rise;  
 Possible changes in reef accretion and nearshore sediment processes with sea level rise; and  
 Possible changes to  sediment supply from future shoreline development and engineering, such 
as construction or removal of coastal armoring or other coastal engineering.  
The calc ulation of the 80% probability contour (landward boundary) of the erosion hazard zone incorporates  
the uncertainty (upper and lower bounds) of th e IPCC RCP8.5 sea level rise projection. This is in contrast 
to the other coastal hazard exposure layers in this study, which use only the upper bound of the RCP8.5 
sea level rise  projection.  
Sea Level Rise Ex posure Area (SLR -XA) 
The SLR -XA represents the projected  area of  chronic (e.g., permanent)  exposure to sea level rise based 
on modeling (1) passive  flooding , (2) annual high wave flooding, and (3) coastal erosion ( Figure 29). Each  
model floods the shoreline in a different way —at different stretches of the shoreline or to greater inland 
extents. There are some areas that are flooded by all three hazards. These areas represent a “triple” threat 
of exposure to sea level rise. Other ar eas with higher elevation topography are only affected by single or 
double hazard threats. It is important that multiple sea level rise hazards are modeled rather than just the 
single “bathtub” hazard, which has been the norm, in order to perceive actual e xposure of coastal land and 
infrastructure to sea level rise . An example of the  SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise  for Hale‘iwa, O‘ahu 
is shown in Figure 30 along with the individual hazards that were used to d evelop the combined map.   Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
51  
Figure 29. Schematic diagram of the SLR -XA as the combined exposure to sea level rise from passive 
flooding, annual high wav e flooding, and coastal erosion  
Assumptions and Limitations.  The assumptions an d limitations described previously for the individual 
hazards apply to the SLR -XA. In addition, it should be noted that for the islands of L āna‘i, Moloka‘i, and 
Hawaiʻi, the SLR -XA represents only one hazard, passive flooding, due to the lack of historical data needed 
to model the other two hazards. Additional studies would be needed to include the annual high wave 
flooding and coastal erosion  in the SLR -XA. The SLR -XA is an overlay of three hazards and does not 
account for interactive nature of these hazards as would be expected by natural processes. As with the 
individual exposure models, the SLR -XA maps hazard exposure on the present landsca pe. The modeling 
does not account for future (unknown) land use changes, including any adaptation measures. T he SLR -XA 
does not include impacts from less frequent high wave events (e.g., 1% -annual -chance coastal flood 
events) from hurricanes, tropical cycl ones, and  tsunamis with sea level rise . These hazards  are not 
addressed in this Report. Further, t he frequency and severity of storms, high waves, and water level 
hazards in the Pacific as modulated by ENSO -related variability and process, other climatic c ycles, and 
additional factors associated with trends and variability resulting from climate change are not modeled in 
this Report.

53 Vulnerability Assessment  
Coastal hazards modeling provides the projected future exposure of our coasts to multiple hazards. A 
vulnerability ass essment estimates the potential social, cultural, economic, and environmental impacts of 
this exposure and provides important information needed to design appropriate strategies and tools to adapt 
to sea level rise. Vulnerability is the degree to which a s ystem is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, 
adverse effects of climate change, 
including climate variability and 
extremes (IPCC 2007) . Vulnerability 
in the SLR -XA is assessed as the 
estimated potential permanent loss of 
land and structures and displaced  
people  from the exposure to sea level  
rise. GIS analysis was used to 
estimate the potential economic loss, 
number of displaced people, and 
length of roads, area of parks, and 
other infrastructure and ecological 
features flooded.  
 
Assessment of Potential Economic, Social, Environmental, and Cu ltural Impacts in 
the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The vulnerability assessment for the SLR -XA uses GIS data collected from federal, state, and county 
agencies including c ounty tax parcel and building footprint data. Data on valued assets is compiled  and 
analyzed at the parcel level (individual property level) . The most recent c ounty tax parcel data provided by 
each county was used to obtain i nformation on the value of land and structure by parcel . The dataset s from 
the counties  also provide d information such as the  footprint, type of structure (e.g. , commercial, residential) 
and construction of buildings (e.g., building materials, structure height), public utilities ( e.g., power, water, 
wastewater) , and critical facilities (e.g. , hospitals, police and fire stations, and evacuation centers).  Data 
layers  from the State GIS database were used to augment the valued assets  for environmental and cultural 
data, land use zones, and other relevant information needed to show the impacts of sea level  rise. Census 
data was used to determine the number of people displaced by sea level rise.  
This approach to assessing vulnerability highlights the value of modeling multiple hazards in defining the 
SLR-XA. As shown in schematic diagram in Figure 29, the combination of passive flooding, annual high 
wave flooding, and erosion is used to define the SLR -XA. In doing so, some areas of the SLR -XA are 
covered by multiple (2 or 3) hazards and some areas are covered by only one of the three hazards. The 
area covered by only one of the three hazards on each island modeled  is significant, accounting for 50% 
to 65% of the area in the SLR -XA (Figure 31). Passive flooding accounts for the majority of the unique area 
contri bution whereas flooding from waves and erosion account for the majority of unique economic loss.  
The Vulnerability Equation  
Vulnerability is assessed as the potential impacts from exposure 
and sensitivity to a hazard and capacity to adapt.

55 This kind of unique contribution analysis2 helps to compare the extent and nature of each hazard’s potential 
harm and underscores the importance of multi -hazard modeling compared to single hazard modeling (e.g., 
bathtub alo ne), which would severely underestimate actual land and economic losses form a multi -faceted 
hazard such as sea level rise. Further, this approach helps to address some of the gaps in the horizontal 
extent (e.g., shoreline coverage for coastal erosion and annual high waves) and vertical extent (e.g., 
landward coverage of DEMs) of coastal hazards modeling noted earlier.  
Potential economic loss is based on the value of the land and structures from the county tax parcel database 
permanently lost in the SLR -XA for each projected sea level rise height. The area exposed to each coastal 
hazard modeled (passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion) is overlaid with the tax 
parcel data to determine the number, type, and value of structures, and va lue of land in each individual 
hazard area.  Potential economic loss is analyzed individually for each hazard at the parcel level and 
subsequently aggregated and reported by sector (agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, 
educational, and religio us) in 1 -hectare (100 square meter or 1,076 square f oot) grid s. Potential economic 
loss in the SLR -XA area is determined from the highest loss value in each sector of any one hazard within 
the 1 -hectare grid, thus avoiding double counting a loss of a parti cular asset from multiple hazards. Those 
maximum values for each sector are then summed to determined the total economic loss to property in 
each grid. E xample maps of the potential ec onomic loss in the SLR -XA at 1.1  and 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
in Kahal ui, Maui are shown in Figure 32. 
The number of people displaced in the SLR -XA was estimated by structure type (single -family residence, 
condominium, and high rise) based on census data. For each census block, the total block population was 
divided by the total number of households based on the 2010 U.S. Census . This resulted in a different 
estimate for number of people per household for each census block, the average of which was around 3 
people  per household across  the state. These estimates were used to assign a number of residents to each 
residential structure, for example, a single -family home might be assigned 3 people per structure while a 
duplex would be assigned 6 people per structure (e.g., two 3 -person hous eholds). For apartments and 
condominiums, several real estate sites such as Zillow , were used to determine the average apartment size 
across the state. A value of 400 square feet per person  was assigned for apartment - and condominium -
type structures. This value was used for all apartment buildings in the state. For example, a 1,200 square 
foot apartment would be assigned three  people.  The to tal square footage for each apartment building  
exposed to the hazard was calculated from the property database and div ided by 400 to determine the 
number of people displaced.  
                                                      
2 The “unique contribution” of a haza rd to the SLR -XA is the area or economic loss that is attributable to only one of the three 
coastal hazards modeled. By depicting the SLR -XA as a composite of passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal 
erosion, additional exposure is identifi ed in terms of area and economic loss. It should be noted that there were breaks in modeling 
annual high wave flooding and coastal erosion which also affect ed the absolute value of the unique contribution.

57 Potential  impacts to roads, water/wastewater conveyance systems, parks, cultural resources, and other 
valued assets are assessed in terms of exposure to chronic flooding in the SLR -XA, but were not monetized. 
The SLR -XA is overlaid with these assets to determine th e miles, numbers, or area extent in acres of assets 
impacted by chronic flooding with sea level rise.  
Assumptions and Limitations.  The vulnerability assessmen t was based on modeling chronic flooding 
using the IPCC AR5 , RCP8.5  sea level rise scenario , which  predicts as much as 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
by the year 2100.  Climate science and sea level rise projections have continued to evolve since the  IPCC 
AR5 and throughout the development of this Report suggesting that 3.2 feet of sea level rise may be 
reached earlier in the second half of this century and sea level rise of 6 .0 feet or more by the end this 
century is “physically plausible. ” As such, vulnerability to sea level rise could possibly occur earlier and 
have greater impacts than projected in this Report.  
The vulnerability assessment addresses primarily exposure toe chronic flooding with sea level rise. Key 
assumptions of the economic analysis for the SLR -XA include: (a) loss is permanent; (b) economic loss is 
based on the value in U.S. dollars in 2 016 as property values in the future are unknown; (c) economic loss 
is based on the value of the land and structures  exposed to flooding in the SLR -XA excluding the contents 
of the property and does not include the economic loss or cost to replace roads, w ater conveyance systems 
and other critical infrastructure; and (d) no adaptation measures are put in place that could reduce impacts 
in the SLR -XA.  
Economic value data was not available for length of roads, water and wastewater lines, and other public 
infrastructure due to the variable cost of such infrastructure depending on location, and the complexity and 
uncertaint y involved in design, siting, and construction . Additionally, environmental assets such as beaches 
and wetlands were not assessed economical ly due to the complexity in valuing ecosystem services. The 
loss of both public infrastructure and environmental assets from flooding will result in significant economic 
loss. Therefore, the total potential economic loss figures estimated in this Report ar e likely an 
underestimate. Building footprints were not available with county tax parcel data for Hawaiʻi County so 
building locations in the SLR -XA and floodplain were approximated manually using publically available 
satellite imagery from Google Earth.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
58 Assessment of Potential Future Shoreline Hardening  and Beach Loss in the SLR -XA 
Over 13 miles of beach on Kaua ‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui 
have been complete ly eroded away in areas fronted  
by seawalls, revetments, and other types of 
shoreline hardening (Fletcher et  al., 2012). 
Historically, shoreline hardening was the typical 
response to protect beachfront property from erosion 
and flooding. The State and Counties have policies 
restricting new shoreline hardening with a focus on 
conserving public beach resources and  shoreline 
access. In addition, Kauaʻi and Maui Counties have 
adopted setback policies based on historical erosion 
rates to move new development out of hazard areas. 
However, regulatory agencies tasked with managing 
coastal resources and shoreline developm ent are 
facing increasing pressure to allow shoreline 
hardening to protect private and public development. 
This pressure will continue to grow in the coming 
years as coastal flooding and erosion due to sea 
level rise impact more and more beachfront 
propert ies.   
Shoreline hardening has been shown to lead to 
beach narrowing and loss when installed on the 
backshore of a sandy beach that is undergoing 
chronic erosion (Fletcher, Mullane, and Richmond 
1997, Romine and Fle tcher 2012, Griggs et al. 1997)  
(Figure 33). Seawalls and other hardening structures 
impound beach sediment in the backshore that 
would otherwise be available to nourish an eroding 
beach. The beach continues to na rrow as sand is 
eroded away fronting the wall, ultimately leading to 
complete beach loss in many locations. This process 
of beach narrowing and loss is accelerated when 
waves begin to impact the wall on a regular basis. 
Shoreline hardening also typically l eads to 
accelerated erosion on adjoining unprotected shorelines as waves and currents bend around the end of the 
structure in a process known as “end scour” or “flanking erosion,” which in turn prompts requests for 
additional shoreline protection on neighb oring properties.  
Figure 33. Shoreline hardening on chronically -
erod ing beaches leads to beach narrowing and 
loss (Griggs et al. 1997)  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
59 Hawaiʻi Sea Grant conducted a GIS -
based assessment of potential future 
shoreline hardening and potential for 
beach loss with 1 .1 feet and 3.2 feet of 
sea level rise for Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui 
using hazard exposure and other map 
data layers from this repor t including the 
SLR-XAs, building footprints, and roads. 
In addition, map layers of existing 
shoreline hardening were acquired for 
Kauaʻi (Bezore, Pap, and Milnes 2013) , 
Oʻahu  (Romine and Fletcher 2013) , and 
Maui (County of Maui Department of 
Planning,  unpublished). Extents of 
historical beach loss are available from 
Fletcher et al. (2012) . Areas of beach and 
backshore sediment deposits were 
verified using satellite i magery and 
geology map layers from the USGS 
(Sherrod et al. 2007) . Beachfront 
buildings and beachfront sections of 
coastal roads within the SLR -XA were 
identified using a standard intersect tool in 
ArcGIS software.  Areas of potential future 
shoreline hardening and beach loss were 
delineated along the shoreline based on 
the buildings and highway segments 
identified within the SLR -XA (Figure 34). 
Sectio ns of overlap among the lines were 
removed to ensure that portions of shoreline were not counted multiple times.  
Assumptions and Limitations.  This assessment is intended to be a first look at potential future impacts 
to beachfront development and beach resources in the state wit h sea level rise. More research is needed 
to improve understanding and projections of localized vulnerability of beach and coastal environments to 
combined impacts of poorly sited beachfront development and erosion and flooding with sea level rise. This 
assessment looks at an overlay of the SLR -XA on existing beachfront development (building footprints and 
roads) , but does not account for accelerated erosion that often occurs fronting and adjacent to shoreline 
structures when waves interact with the structu re. The database of existing shoreline hardening comes 
from multiple sources developed using aerial photography and verified by site visits in some locations, and 
may not include all shoreline hardening. This assessment also focuses on active open -coast be ach systems

Miles of beach exposed to potential loss provided in this Report are based on a hypothetical scenario where 
widespread shoreline hardening is permitted along impacted beachfront property and does not consider 
other adaptation scenarios such as managed retreat of existing development from impacted areas , 
increased setbacks for new development , or beach nourishment , which would help to conserve  beaches.  
 
Learning Questions for the 5 -Year Report Update  
Learning questions for this chapter are driven by the assumption that sea level rise projections will be 
modified based on new climate science, and new approaches will be tested and applied to c oastal hazard 
modeling and vulnerability assessment. There are many ongoing efforts in the United States and around 
the world to better characterize vulnerability to sea level rise using different models and approaches (USGS 
2017) . As such, learning questions for the 5 -year Report update include:  
1. To what extent do  new global sea level rise projections differ from those used in this hazard 
modeling ? 
2. To what extent have data and coastal hazard modeling improved to warrant updating this hazard 
modeling?  
3. To what extent have property values, population, and other develo pment trajectories changed 
from the baseline data used in this report?  
4. Is the SLR -XA for 3.2 feet of sea level rise modeled in the Report still valid as the exposure 
overlay for the mid to latter half of this century ?

As the only U.S. state that is made up of island s, Hawaiʻi is highly 
vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. In this chapter, we present 
the Report’s findings from a state -wide perspective.  
Vulnerability to sea level rise  is based on modeling chronic coastal 
flooding with sea level rise  due to  passive flooding, annual high 
wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of 
sea l evel rise  and depicts flood hazards that may occur in the mid - 
to latter -half of this century  (Box 4). Vulner ability to 1. 1 feet of sea 
level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term 
exposure to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Vulnerability is 
assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, people, property, 
cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure.  
The reade r is urged to exercise caution in interpreting the results, 
which  could be to a greater or less er extent  depending on actual 
observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate 
change mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as 
well as future societal choices which cannot be known tod ay.

Call to Action  
“We have the science, the vis ion, and the 
leadership to take up the challenge that 
sea level rise poses to our communities 
and economy. Our kuleana is to act to 
preserve our environment, culture and 
lifestyle in the inevitable change. These 
actions include using public education to 
explain the risks and opportunities and 
create a groundswell of support for 
action and forming coalitions and cross 
agency collaborations to develop 
proactive options to be enacted by state 
and county governments and supported 
by the public. As a result, we will 
produce integrated and long -term plans 
that address sea level risk holistically 
across multiple sectors .”

  Box 4. Summary of Key Terms, Assumptions, and Limitations in the Methodology Used to Assess 
Vulnerability in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area (SLR -XA) 
This summary is intended to help the reader become familiar with key terms, assumptions, and 
limitations in the mo deling and vulnerability assessment methodology. The reader is encouraged to 
revisit the Methodology chapter for further details.   
 The SLR -XA depicts the area exposed to potential chronic flooding and land loss based on 
modeling passive flooding, annual hi gh wave flooding, and coastal erosion with sea level rise 
for the Islands of Maui, O‘ahu, and Kaua‘i,. The SLR -XA for the Islands o f Hawaiʻi, Moloka‘i, 
and Lāna‘i is based on modeling passive flooding only.  
 Flooding in the SLR -XA is associated with long -term, chronic hazards punctuated by annual or 
more frequent flooding events. Over time, recurring flooding at the highest tides in lo w-lying 
areas leads to chronic flooding and then to permanent flooding, and permanent loss.  
 Vulnerability in the SLR -XA is characterized as potential impacts to land use, people and 
property, critical infrastructure, Native Hawaiian communities, cultural resources, and coastal 
resources, including beaches.  
Key assumptions and limitations of the vulnerability assessment include:  
 Potential economic loss is based on present values of the land and structures from the county 
tax parcel database permanently lo st in the SLR -XA. 
 Economic (monetary) losses due to sea level rise on critical infrastructure (such as roads, 
airports, harbors, water, sewer and power, etc.) has not been considered, but many such 
structures or facilities that are located in the SLR -XA ha ve been identified in this Report.  
 A more detailed economic loss analysis is needed of Oahu’s critical infrastructure, including 
harbor facilities, airport facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads. State and County 
agencies should consider potential  long-term cost savings from implementing sea level rise 
adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than later) 
compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure 
in place over  the next 30 to 70 years.  
 Macro -economic impacts (such as on tourism or the real estate market) resulting from 
potential chronic flooding over time caused by sea level rise are not analyzed.

State -wide  Summary  
Although sea level rise i s analyzed at the individual island level in the Report, it is important to understand 
its state -wide impacts. This section quantifies some of the assets across the State that could be lost to 
chronic flooding in the SLR-XA. 
Key Take Aways  
 Chronic coastal flooding is occurring now. The SLR -XA with 1.1 feet of sea level rise approximates 
this current or near -term exposure to chronic coastal flooding.  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, chronic flooding with sea level rise will increase, impacting homes and 
busines ses located near the shoreline. Approximately 6,500 structures and 19,800 people state -
wide would be exposed to chronic flooding in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
 State -wide, the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise covers an area of approxi mately 25,800 
acres, one third of which is designated for urban use.  
 An estimated $19 billion of economic loss would result from chronic flooding of land and structures 
located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.

 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
64  Approximately 38 miles of co astal roads would be chronically flooded within the SLR -XA with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise and  become  potentially impassible, jeopardizing critical access to many 
communities.  
 Approximately 550 cultural sites would become chronically flooded within the SL R-XA with 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise.  
 More than 13 miles of beaches have been lost on Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui to erosion fronting 
seawalls and other shoreline armoring. Many more miles of beach could be lost with sea level rise, 
if widespread armoring is allowed.  
 Flooding, hurricanes, and tro pical cyclones could occur at any time and w ould be exacerbated by 
sea level rise.  
 Actions are needed now to increase Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise.  
Potential Impacts in Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
When sea level rises another 3.2 feet ov er the 21st century, the State of Hawai‘i stands to lose over 25, 800 
acres  of coastal and low -lying land to chronic flooding (Figure 35). This loss will take the form of 
incrementally eroding beaches, waterfront pr operty inundated by increasingly high tides and by seasonal 
waves that reach father inland, and low -lying areas becoming wetlands because of rising water tables and 
reduced drainage. O‘ahu, with its expansive coastal plains, will lose the most land, follow ed by Kauaʻi and 
Hawai‘i. While the total amount of land loss will amount to less than 1% of the State’s total land, much of 
this land encompasses high density urban, commercial, and industrial districts.  
State -wide, approximately 6,500 structures would b e chronically flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
resulting in the displacement of more than 19,80 0 residents. The projected total value of land and structures 
that would be lost amounts to over $ 19 billion. Approximately 38 miles of road would be chro nically flooded 
across the State with 3.2 feet of sea level rise, ranging from residential roads to sections of coastal highways 
such as Kūhiō Highway on Kauaʻi, Kamehameha Highway on O‘ahu, and Honoapi‘ilani Highway on Maui. 
Utilities, such as water, wastewater, and electrical syste ms, that often run parallel underneath roadways, 
would also be significantly impacted.  However, the reader should note that t he $19 billion  in economic loss 
does not encompass the full extent of potential losses in the State. As stated in Chapter 3 (Method ology), 
economic value data were not available for length of roads, water and wastewater lines, and other public 
infrastructure due to the variable cost of such infrastructure  and the complexit y and uncertainty involved in 
design, siting, and construction  of such facilities . Thus, the total potential economic loss figures throughout 
the State are likely an underestimate.

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
66 The loss o f natural and cultural resources across all islands is also difficult to quantify —yet their loss would 
cost the State dearly. Sea level rise would take its toll on Hawaii’s world famous beaches, including such 
iconic stretches of beaches such as North Shor e Oahu’s “Seven Mile Miracle,” the beaches of Kauai’s North 
Shore, and West Maui beaches, unless drastic measures are taken to curb the practice of shoreline 
armoring. Many Native Hawaiian cultural resources would be impacted as nearly 550 cultural sites i n the 
State would be chronically flooded in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise and cultural practices 
including fishing, gathering, and other practices that require shoreline access would be impacted. Further, 
coastal portions of Hawaiian Home Land s could be impacted by chronic flooding.  
Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that could release wastewater or hazardous materials 
and waste to nearshore waters and coastal habitats. Septic tanks, cesspools, and other on -site sewage 
disposal systems (OSDS) as well as other hazard materials/waste storage and disposal sites are located 
along the coast. Approximately 2,100 OSDSs would be exposed to chronic flooding in the SLR -XA with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise state -wide that would not o nly result in the failure of these systems to operate properly 
but degrade nearshore water quality.  
Challenges and Opportunities  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, as sea level rises, homes and businesses located on or near the shoreline 
throughout the State wi ll become exposed to chronic flooding. Portions of coastal roads may become 
flooded, eroded, impassible, and potentially irreparable, jeopardizing access to and from many 
communities. The flooding of hotels and transportation systems would impact the visit or economy and thus 
impact the people whose livelihoods depend on the tourism  industry . The added risk of flooding from 
hurricanes and tropical cyclones from a warming planet poses a potential for loss of human life and property 
and for severe and long -term economic disruption.  
The impact of sea level rise on O‘ahu is greater than all of the other islands combined due to  the size of the 
population and extensive urbanization of vulnerable coastal areas.  Even more troubling is the fact that 
impacts from chron ic flooding with sea level rise on O‘ahu can reverberate and translate into economic and 
social impacts for the other islands.  
In addition to chronic coastal flooding from sea level rise, t ropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis create 
waves that flood l ow-lying coastal areas. However, the added risk from event -based coastal flooding 
exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report. Flood risk zones subject to inundation from the 
1%-annual chance flood are designated as special flood hazard ar eas (SFHAs) on the  Federal Insurance 
Rate Maps (FIRMs)  produced by FEMA . It is important though that the reader understands that event -
based coastal flooding with sea level rise would expand the landward extent of these SFHAs.  
The results of the vulnerabi lity assessment highlight just a few of the very significant  challenges the State 
faces under a scenario of 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the mid - to latter -part of the century. However, this 
may not be the worst of it. According to recent climate science,  sea level rise greater than 6 feet is 
“physically plausible ” by the end of the century (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
67 While not modeled in this Report, additional feet of sea level rise would add thousands of acres to the SLR -
XA on each island (Figure 36). A GIS analysis using layers from the NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 
2017b) , which only accounts for passive flooding, indicates that an additional 10,000 acres state -wide would 
be added to the SLR -XA with 5 feet of sea level rise . This would increas e the total area exp osed to chronic 
flooding state -wide to over 36,000 acres and the economic, environmental, cultural and societal impacts of 
which would be far greater than the results presented in this Report. Each island’s exposure to passive 
flooding with 5 feet of sea l evel varies due to its geomorphology , with O‘ahu having the highest additional 
exposure (36%) and Maui, having the lowest additional exposure  (15%) in terms of additional acres  
passively flooded . 
 
Figure 36. Potential additional a rea of chronic flooding with 5 feet of sea level rise  
The threat of 3 feet or more of sea level rise in this century is real and is not likely to diminish given the 
overall trend in scientific research toward higher and more rapid scenarios of sea level ri se in this century. 
This state -wide vulnerability assessment provides the information needed to consider the potential impacts 
of sea level rise in planning future land use decisions by depicting the areas exposed to flooding in this 
century and providing a framework for adaption. Invariably, adaption to sea level rise will require difficult 
decisions regarding when, where, and how to act on this information.

Hawai‘i  
The Island of Hawai‘i,  with an area of more than 2.5 million acres, is the largest isl and in the Hawaiian 
archipelago . With a population of  189,382  residents  (State of Hawai'i 2015) , the Island of  Hawai‘i  accounts 
for only 14% of the State's  total population . However, a n almost tripling of Hawai ‘i Island ’s population over 
the last 50 years , coupled with a growing tourism industry —over 1.5 million visitors came to Hawai‘i Island  
in 201 6 (State of Hawai'i 2016) —has placed ever increasing demand s on the island’s housing market, 
natural resources, critical infrastructure, and basic services. Be that as it may, Hawaii’s large size, relatively 
low population,  and unique geography/geology makes it the least vulnerable of the main Hawaiian Island s 
to sea level rise  impacts. Nonetheless, the Island of Hawai‘i faces serious flooding threats in some of its 
main urban a reas, including low -lying areas in Kona, Puakō, and Hilo Bay.

69 Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, homes and businesses located near the shoreline will be impacted by 
sea level rise. Approximately 130 structures would be chronically flooded with  3.2 feet of sea level 
rise. 
 Of the 4,500 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, approximately 20% is designated for urban 
land uses.  
 A more detailed economic loss analysis is needed of Hawaii’s  critical infrastructure, including harbor 
facilities, airp ort facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads.  
 State and County agencies should consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea 
level rise adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than later) 
comp ared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in 
place over the next 30 to 70 years.  
This section provides a picture of the future of the Island of  Hawai‘i with sea level rise and the potential 
impacts if no act ion is taken. The results are  based on modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise  due to 
passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise , and depict s flood hazards that may occur in th e mid - to latter -half of this century . This timeframe 
is within the expected lifespan of most new construction and much of our existing development. It should 
be noted that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible ” by the end of the 
century, based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . 
Vulnerability to 1. 1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure 
to coastal hazards and sea level rise.  Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, 
people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure  (only land and structures are 
monetized, not infrastructure) .  
The reade r is urged to exercis e caution in interpreting the results, which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as future soc ietal choices which cannot be 
known today. Further,  the reader  should visit the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore  the full extent

  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
70 Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from exposure to passive flooding with sea level 
rise. For the purposes of exposure and planning, we focus mainly on a scenario with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying coastal areas around the island within the SLR -XA may become 
chronically flooded within the mid- to latter -half of this century (Figure 37). This land will become submerged 
by coastal erosion, direct marine flooding from tides and waves, or become new wetlands behind the 
shoreline from rising water tables  and reduced drainage. Approximately 4,550  acres of  land on the Island 
of Hawai‘i is estimated to be located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Some exampl es of areas 
that would be exposed to chronic flooding, including Ka‘ūpūlehu , Waimea , South Point , and the Hawaiian  
Beaches subdivision, are illustrated on Figure 38. Portions of the Hu ālalai Resort in Ka ‘ūpūlehu, an 
economically important tourist  destination in North Kona , would be permanently flooded  with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise. In Waimea, n ew and expanding wetland areas would form around the historical, agricultural areas 
and the black sand beaches may begin to erode . In South Point, e xisting Hawaiian farmsteads, coastal 
resources and recreation areas  are already experiencing recurring flooding during high tides without rainfall 
because of rising seas.  At the Hawaiian Beaches subdivision, as the shoreline erodes with rising seas, 
properties along the shoreline would become increasingly vulnerable to flooding and the beach would 
eventually be lost if structures , such as seawalls impede the landward migration of the beach. In addition, 
along the Hāmākua coast, bluff erosion and potentially catastrophic bluff failures would increase with higher 
sea le vel. 
Over time, as sea level continues to rise, low -lying, populated coastal communities such as the small 
residential village of Puakō in South Kohala, would experience increased frequency and extent of flooding 
(Figure 39). This  flooding could possibly lead to permanent inundation, especially given the high water table 
in the area (County of Hawai'i 2005) , ultimately making some areas of the coast impassible or uninhabitable. 
Decisions about where to use coastal armoring and when to retreat will need to be made carefully. It should 
be noted that sea walls may not be effective at preventing flooding with sea level rise in many low -lying 
areas as rising groundwater can infiltrate through porous geology.  While specific responses to sea level 
rise would need to be place -based, larger regional issues shoul d also be considered, such as whether to 
armor in place or whether to relocate roads and other critical infrastructure inland. In the case of  the town 
of Puak ō, where seasonal wave overtopping and flooding are already an issue,  there may be opportunities 
to consider a managed retreat strategy as there are ample vacant lands immediately mauka  (landward)  
and outside of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, as discussed in the Recommendations 
Chapter of this Report (Chapter 5), and as with  other populated coastal areas with adjacent vacant  lands, 
large -scale boundary amendments should be predicated on appropriate state policies and guidelines (e.g., 
within Chapter 205, State Land Use Act) to provide the supportive legal basis for major land use changes.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

74 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
While sea level rise would result in impacts within the State U rban, Agricultural, and Conservation  Land 
Use Districts  around the island, Conservation  District lands  would experience the greatest extent of chronic 
flooding (Figure 40). While approximately 76% of the lands located within the SLR -XA are designated as 
Conservation District lands, o nly 20% of the lands located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
are located in the Urban District . However, c onsidering that only 2% of the island’s more than 2.5 million 
acres is in the Urban Land Use District (State of Hawai'i 201 5), it’s likely that new Urban District land would 
need to be designated to respond to shifts in coastal infrastructure and population away from the shoreline.  
While the State Land Use Law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 205) could be used to sort out m ajor land 
changes as part of a managed retreat strategy, County General Plan and Community Plan updates provide 
important opportunities to address land use issues with rising seas at the local level. Revised and updated 
Special Management Areas (SMA) polic ies, objectives, and requirements offer additional opportunities at 
the local level to prepare for sea level rise. Additional controls on development along the coast may be 
necessary to  protect Native Hawaiian trad itional and customary practices;  iwi kūpuna (ancestral bones) ; 
archaeological/historical, and cultural resources; to ensure public access; and to mitigate the impacts of 
coastal hazards.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zon e in the County 
General Plan and Community Plan updates . 
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vulnerable urban areas with preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR -XA, whe rever possible, under a 
long-term comprehensive adaptation strategy . 
 
POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOPLE AND PROPERTY  
People living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced when homes, condominiums, and 
businesses become flooded due to sea level rise. T he potential number of people displaced is calculated 
by assigning an estimated occupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. Potential economic loss  in 
the SLR -XA is estimated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss estimates are ass essed 
at the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids. The potential economic loss associated with flooded 
roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastructure is not accounted for in the assessment of 
economic impacts and would ad d significant increases in losses.  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
75  
Figure 40. Estimated percentage of Land Use Districts impacted in the 3.2 feet sea level rise exposure area 
on the Island of Hawai‘i  
The potential number of displaced people island -wide could  rise from 452 residents with 1.1 feet of sea 
level rise to over 1,000 residents with 3.2 feet of sea level ris e (Figure 41). The people dis placed would 
include a range of income levels and living arrangements . Approximately 34% of the occupied housing 
units  on the Island of Hawai‘i are occupied  by renters (U.S. Census Bureau 2015a) , so both homeowners 
and renters would be affected island -wide.  
Potential economic losses (all structures and land) island -wide would increase from an estimated $ 195 
million  with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise to $ 426 million  with 3.2 feet of sea level  rise ( Figure 41). Approximately  
63% of the potential economic loss with 3.2 feet of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of residential 
structures and land . The potential economic loss across all sectors results from loss of 132 structures  and 
approximately 4,550 acres  of land  in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, potential economic loss would occur in low-lying coastal areas island -wide, 
with the greatest loss along the northeastern shore from Puak ō to Kailua -Kona due to the concentration of  
high-value residential, commercial and resort land and structures  (Figure 42). Over  time, as sea level 
continues to rise, coastal communities and resort areas , such as those between Waikōloa and Puak ō in 
the South  Kohala Community Planning District ( Figure 43), would experience increasing potential economic 
loss.

79 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
Sea level rise would  result in significant impacts to roads, airports, harbors, electrical and 
telecommunications, water/wastewater  facilities and  conveyance systems , and other public service facilities 
(i.e. schools, fire stations, police stations, me dical facilities) on the Island of Hawai‘i. Following the trends 
of private development, portions of the island’s  critical public infrastructure is concentrated along low -lying 
shores and is vulnerable to flooding  and erosion in the SLR -XA. No major highwa ys would be flooded in 
the SLR -XA with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise  and only 0.05  miles  would be flooded  with 3.2  feet of sea level 
rise. Portions of coastal roads, such as Kalaniana ‘ole Avenue in Hilo, would become chronically flooded 
(Figure 44) and result in regional issues such as loss of commerce, loss of access to emergency services, 
and increased traffic on other roads and highways , some of which serve as the only access in and out of 
many communities. Electric  and telecommunication transmission lines commonly follow roads and those 
located underground in the SLR -XA may be impacted by sea level rise resulting in service disruptions.  
Three  of the islands  four airports, Hilo International, Kona International , and ‘Upolu  Airport, lie along the 
coast , but are located on higher ground outside of the SLR -XA (Figure 45). However, operations at the 
island’s two commercial harbors, Hilo ( Figure 45) and Kawaihae ( Figure 46), may be impacted and could 
experience disrupti on of  more than 4,000 tons of cargo (based on the amount of cargo that passed through 
the harbors in 2014 ) (State of Hawai'i 2015) . In addition, disruption can also be expected to cruise ships 
and their passengers that pass through these harbors a s well as at the Kailua -Kona Wharf.  Further, 
interruption to interisland and transoceanic shipp ing and travel would impact residents, visitors, and all 
forms of economic activity.  No schools, fire stations, police stations, hospitals or wastewater treatment 
plants are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.   
More detailed analyses  of vulnerability and adaptation options for critical infrastructure are needed to 
evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocating the Island of Hawaii’s critical infrastructure. 
State and County agencies should consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level 
rise adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., flood proofing and relocating infrastructure sooner than 
later) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in p lace 
over the next 30 to 70 years.  The reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to determine 
if any infrastructure or public facilities of interest are located within the SLR -XA. Plea se keep in mind that 
infrastructure losses have not been monetized. However, i t should be noted that these costs could  be an 
order of magnitude greater than the potential economic lo sses estimated from  land and structure s.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provide for the economic self -sufficiency of Native Hawaiians 
through a homesteading program (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Home Lands include areas from mauka to makai  (from the mountain to the sea). Coastal portions 
of Hawaiian Home Lands, such  as in Kawaihae  in South Kohala ( Figure 46), would be flooded with sea 
level rise displacing Native Hawaiian families that live in this area. In addition, fishing and cultural practices 
taking place along the shore  would be impacted as beaches erode. In a recent study of multiple coastal 
hazards, three  of the 27 Hawaiian Home Lands homesteads on the Island of Hawai‘i —Keaukaha, Maku’u, 
and Kawaihae —are estimated to have the greatest potential for people to be displac ed by tsunamis, waves, 
and sea level rise (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . 
In addition to Native Hawaiian communities, m any Native Hawaiian cultural and historical resources  are 
located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosion already  threatens areas 
that serve as burial grounds, home sites, fishponds, and other places of cultural significance (Kane et al. 
2012) . The number of cultural sites on the Island of Hawai‘i in the SLR -XA is projected to increase from 131 
sites with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise to 132 sites with 3.2 feet  of sea level rise. This includes a number of 
cultur al sites such as historic trails, heiau, and petroglyphs located along the shoreline of Pōhue Bay  that 
may be flooded as a result of sea level rise ( Figure 47). Rising seas would  also impa ct loko i‘a (anci ent 
Hawaiian fishponds) such as  the loko i‘a of Ka loko and ‘Aimakapā  located on Honok ōhau Bay  (Figure 48) 
(Marrack and O'Grady 2014) . A case study on sea level rise impacts on Kaloko fishpond within the Kaloko -
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
82 Honok ōhau National Historical Park indicated that the area of the pond would expand under different sea 
level rise scenarios and would expand beyond the current park boundary with approximately 3.3 feet of sea 
level rise. Rising seas may also impact the Ala Kah akai National Historic Trail. A recent coastal hazard 
analysis report of the Pu‘ukoholā Heiau National Historic Site  and Kaloko Honokōhau Historical Park 
projects a higher frequency of coastal  flooding in the area due to sea  level rise  (Vitousek et al. 2009) . 
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Develop an inventory of Native Hawaiian cul tural resources and practices impacted by sea level 
rise. 
 Work with Native Hawaiian communities to determine steps they want to take regarding climate 
impacts . 
 Develop adaption plans to preserve access to coastal lands and water within Native Hawaiian 
comm unities .

84 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  COASTAL RESOURCES AN D PUBLIC ACCESS  
The Island of Hawaiʻi has more than 305 miles of coastline, but approximately 75% of it is made up of cliffs 
of varying heights (County of Hawai'i 2005) . While only 25% of its coastline is beaches, these beaches play 
a critical role in recre ation for residents and the overall economy.  
Approximately 692 acres of public beaches and parks (inclusive of city, state and federal parks) on the 
Island of Hawai‘i are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Many of these parks, such  
as Hōnaunau  County Park and Pu’uohonua o Hōnaunau  National Historical Park  (Figure 49) are located 
on the seaward side of major roads, and demonstrate how lightly -developed parkland can provide a buffer 
between er osion and flood -prone shorelines and development for many decades.  
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats vital to aquatic organisms and wildlife would 
become flooded with sea level rise, changing the nature of such  habitat s and the org anisms that rely on  
them . Estuarine habitats, where freshwater from rivers and streams, and saltwater from the sea meet and 
mix, would become increasingly marine with rising se as. This dynamic would impact areas such as Hakalua 
Stream and Beach Park locate d in South Hilo ( Figure 50). Hawaiian anchialine pools , land-locked bodies 
of water of varying salinity that are adjacent to the ocean  (The Nature Conservancy 2012) , are occupied by 
small endemic red shrimp ( Halocaridina  and others) called ʻōpaeʻula and the  endangered shrimp, Procaris 
hawaiana  (Fish and Wildlife Servi ce 2016) . These pools have indirect, unde rground connections to the sea, 
and show tid al fluctuations in water level. Other species,  restricted to the surface waters of the pools,  include 
a few fish species, crust aceans and other invertebrates. Two endanger ed waterbirds (Hawaiian Stilt and 
Hawaiian Coot), and several species  of migratory waterfowl also use these pools  (The Nature Conservancy 
2012) .  A study of anchialine pools  in Kaloko -Honokōhau National Historical Park, found that 53% of the 
ponds would be inundated with 3.3 feet (1.0 meter) o f sea level rise and 97% of the ponds would be 
inundated with 6.2 feet (1.9 meters) of sea level rise (Marrack and O'Grady 2014) . However, the study also 
indicated that new pools could form if the areas were protected as open space to allow for such emergence.   
Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. Septic ta nks, cesspools and other OSDS, as well as hazardous 
materials storage  and disposal sites could become flooded and release wastewater or c ontaminants to 
nearshore waters.  On the Island of Hawai‘i, OSDS a re located along many urban and rural shoreline areas , 
such as along the shoreline of Kapoho ( Figure 51). Releases from these OSDS may change disease  risk 
for coral reefs  and negatively impacting nearby coral resources, such as those off the coast of Puak ō (Kim 
et al. 2014) . Island -wide, there are approximately 94 OSDS  within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise. The reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer to determine if infrastructure of 
interest is located in the SLR -XA.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

87 Challenges and Opportunities  
Over the n ext 30 to 70 years, properties located on or near the Island of Hawaii’s shorelines will increasingly 
be flooded, eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Portions of coastal roads will also become flooded, 
eroded, impassible, and irreparable, jeopardizing a ccess to and from many communities. B eaches, such 
as those between Kailua -Kona and Kawaihae,  will increasingly be eroded and permanently lost if hard 
structures such as roads and seawalls impede their landward migration. The flooding of hotels and 
transpor tation systems,  along with the loss of beaches, would impact not only the people whose livelihoods 
depend on it, but the State’s economy which relies heavily on revenues from the tourism industry. This 
Results section highlights just a few of the very real  challenges on the Island of Hawai‘i with a scenario of 
3.2 feet of sea level rise by the mid - to the latter -part of the century.  
Sea level rise will not stop at the middle or end of the century. As highlighted throughout this Report, higher 
sea level ris e projections are considered physically plausible by the end of the century based on the latest 
climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . While this Report models sea 
level rise up to 3.2 feet, it should be noted tha t NOAA has model ed passive flooding  scenarios with up to 6 
feet of sea level rise in their Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from 
higher sea level scenarios, we  incorporated th e 5-foot passive  flood layer  from NOAA into our vulnerability 
assessment which increases the area of the SLR -XA for the Island of  Hawaiʻi by 18%. Figure 52 shows the 
potential extent of 5 feet of passive flooding with sea level rise in Kailua -Kona. While there is uncertainty 
over when the islands might experience such extreme sea level rise, the information  is provided to remind 
readers that sea level rise is going to continue for the remainder of the century and beyond.  
With abundant land outside of the SLR -XA, the Island of Hawai‘i has opportunities to plan for sea level rise 
now by considering County Gen eral Plan and Community Plan updates that recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone and to plan for future land use now. In addition to chronic coastal 
flooding from sea level rise, t ropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunam is create waves that  flood low -lying 
coastal areas. The added risk from event -based coastal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise is not 
included in this Report. However, these events pose  a potential for loss of human life and property , and for 
severe an d long -term economic disruption. Communities should consider planning new development to 
reduce exposure from severe events by recognizing that the coastal floodplain will migrate landward with 
increased sea level  rise. Hazard mitigation and disaster recov ery projects should be reviewed and revised 
to address chronic and event -based flooding and consider the additive effects of accelerating sea level rise.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

County of Hawai‘i  
CONSIDERING SEA LEVE L RISE IN SUSTAINABL E COMMUNITIES AND DE VELOPMENT PLANS  
The coastline of the Island of  Hawai‘i is long and diverse, with mostly basalt rock shoreline interrupted by 
pockets of sandy beach. This geology lends itself to coastal hazards that differ from other islands where beach 
erosion, for instance, is more prevalent. Instead, low -lying areas of the Island of Hawai‘i are susceptible to 
other impacts associated with sea level rise, such as flooding of inland areas at high tides and episodic events, 
such as storm surge and tsunamis, which pose a less frequent but more severe concern. The County of Hawai‘i 
is working to protect and manage thei r coastal development through research, planning, and policy.  
Having studies to inform action, Bethany Morrison from the Hawai‘i County Planning Department explained, is 
crucial to implementing good policy. For example, a study was conducted in Kapoho, in  the district of Puna, on 
the eastern tip of the Island of Hawai‘i, to determine the rate of subsidence —a geologic phenomenon where 
the land gradually sinks in elevation. “We have been able to successfully use that subsidence rate to increase 
the base floo d elevation requirements for some structures being built in the Special Management Area [SMA],” 
said Morrison.  
The lesson from this, Morrison explained, is that sea level rise can be treated much in the same way as 
subsidence in coastal areas within the SM A. Areas near the coast at risk of subsidence that contain valuable 
natural resources are protected by additional regulations and permits. SMA, defined in Act 176, SLH 1975, 
refers to the land extending not less than one hundred yards inland from the “shor eline”  including the 
surrounding area extending one hundred yards from the border of any body of surface water subject to salinity 
intrusion or tidal influences and the waters themselves.  SMA permits are issued by counties to regulate 
appropriate land use.  
“The SMA has been a good tool. It allows for a little more dialogue,” said Morrison in regards to using SMA 
permits to require coastal development to consider coastal hazards in their plan. “Because otherwise if 
[landowners] meet the code requirements, th ey can develop, but in the SMA we can mitigate for any impacts.”  
“Sea level rise as a coastal hazard is one of many,” Morrison said, which means that it can be treated and 
managed like other coastal hazards such as subsidence. By using existing regulatory frameworks such as the 
SMA, the County of Hawai‘i could require coastal development to factor in sea level rise alongside other coastal 
hazards. In order to employ this useful tool, the County of Hawaii’s next step will need to be acquiring island -
specific  data on how sea level rise will impact the coastline.

Maui  
The Island of Maui, known as “Th e Valley Isle,” is the largest and most populous island in Maui County . 
Maui boasts a varied geography with coastal communities and mountainous areas in West Maui, small 
towns and agricultural communities in Upcountry and East Maui, and the more urbanized areas of Central 
Maui  (County of Maui 2012) . With 148,40 3 residents (State of Hawai'i 2015) , the Island  of Maui accounts 
for 10.6% of the State's population . Since the 1970s, Maui has experienced significant growth in both 
resident and visitor populations . A near tr ipling of Maui ’s population over the last 50 years , coupled with a 
growing tourism industry —over 2.6 million visitors came to Maui in 201 6 (State of Hawai'i 2016)  —has 
placed ever increasing demands on natural resources, critical infrastructure, and basic services.  
Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30  to 70 years, homes and businesses located near the shoreline will be severely 
impacted by sea level rise. Nearly 300 structures would be chronically flooded with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise.  
 Of the 3,130 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, approximately a third of those lands are 
designated for urban land uses.  
 With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, more than 11 miles of major coastal roads would become impassible 
jeopardizing critical access to and from many communities.  
 Maui has lost more than 4 miles of beaches to coastal erosion fronting seawalls and other shoreline 
armoring. Many more miles of beach could be lost with sea level rise, if widespread armoring is 
allowed.

91  A more detailed economic loss analysis is needed of Maui’s critical infrastructure, including harbor 
facilities, airport facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads. State and Counties should consider 
potential benefits in terms of long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption 
measures now (e.g., major flood proofing or relocation) comp ared to the cost of maintaining and 
repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure over the next 30  to 70 years.  
This section provides a picture of the future of the sland of Maui with sea level rise and the potential impacts 
from chronic flooding.  The results are based on modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise due to passive 
flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea level rise, 
and depicts flood hazards that may occur in the mid - to lat ter-half of this century. This timeframe is within 
the expected lifespan of most new construction and much of our existing development. It should be noted 
that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible” by the end of the ce ntury, 
based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . Vulnerability 
to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure to coastal 
hazards and sea level ris e. Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, people, 
property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure (only land and structures are monetized, 
not infrastructure).  
The reader is urged to exercise caution in interpreting the results, which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as future societal choices  which cannot be 
known today. Further, as not all parts of the island can be shown in detail, the reader should also visit the 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore the full extent of the vulnerabili ty maps for each island.  
Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from the combined exposure to passive flooding, 
annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion with sea level rise. With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying 
coastal areas around t he island within the SLR -XA would  become chronically flooded within the mid - to 
latter -half of this century (Figure 53). This land will become submerged as a result of coastal erosion, coastal 
flooding from tides and waves, or become new wetlands behind the shoreline from rising water tables and 
reduced drainage. Approximately 3,130 acres of land on Maui is estimated to be located in the SLR -XA, 
with one third of that lo cated in the Urban District.  
Towns such as Waihe ‘e, Hana , Lāhainā, Kīhei, and others, that are vulnerable to the effects of sea level 
rise are shown in Figure 54. Waihe‘ e is a small rural town located on the northwest side of the island where 
portions of the Waihe ‘e Coastal Dune and Wetla nds Refuge would be  permanently  flooded with 3.2 feet of 
sea level rise. In the town of Hana, higher sea levels would form n ew wetland s that would impact  rural 
homeowners. Lāhainā, the former capital of the State of Hawai ʻi and an important seaport, is an urban 
settlement in West Maui backed by agricultural lands and the West Maui Mountains. With 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise, Lāhainā ’s historic district would be exposed to chronic flooding, along with portions of the town 
itself which  is West Maui’s visitor, service, commercial and residential center.  Kīhei is the residential and Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
92 commercial center of  Southwest Maui . It has been identified as a planned growth area in the County due 
to the existing opportunities to expand outward from current settlement areas (County of Maui 2010) . 
However, many areas in Kīhei may succumb to flooding from sea level rise. Thoughtful planning about 
where and how th is expansion could occur is important to ensure new development is resilient to sea level 
rise.  
Over time, as sea level continues to rise, low -lying, populated coas tal communities such as Spreckelsville  
would experience increased frequency  and severity  of flooding , ultimately making some areas of the coast 
impassible or uninhabitable (Figure 55). Decisions about where to use coastal armoring and when to retreat 
will need to be made carefully. It should be noted that seawalls may n ot be effective at preventing flooding 
with sea level rise  in many low -lying areas as rising groundwater can infiltrate through porous geology. 
While specific responses to sea level rise would need to be place -based, larger regional issues should also 
be c onsidered, such as whether to armor in place or whether to relocate roads and other critical 
infrastructure inland. In the case of Spreckelsville and similar coastal communities , there may be  
opportunities for managed retreat inland, as there are ample vac ant lands immediately mauka (landward) 
and outside of the SLR -XA. However, as discussed in the Recommendations Chapter of this Report 
(Chapter 5), and as with other populated coastal areas with adjacent vacant lands, large -scale boundary 
amendments should  be predicated on appropriate state policies and guidelines (e.g., within Chapter 205, 
State Land Use Act) to provide the supportive legal basis for major land use changes.

96 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
While sea level rise would affect lands within the State U rban, Agricultural, Conservation, and Rural Land 
Use Districts around the island , Conservation  District lands would experience the greatest extent of chronic 
flooding , followed by Urban District lands (Figure 56). Over half of the 3,130 acres located in the SLR -XA 
are designated as Conse rvation while almost a third is designated for Urban use. Thus, it can be expected 
that new Urban  District  lands would need to be designated to accommodate redevelopment away from the 
shoreline.  However, the island of Maui is unique in that agricultural la nd is the “default” district designation 
for any lands not formally designated as Urban, Rural, or Conservation. Many of  these “default” lands 
frequently border more urbanized areas (County of Maui 2012)  which would allow for the potential 
expansion of the adjacent urban areas . This concept coincides with The M aui Island Plan which identifies 
lands abutting Kahului, Waikap ū, Lāhainā , and northeast Kīhei as areas that could provid e such  
opportunities for conversion and expansion (County of Maui 2012) .  
While the State Land Use Law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 205) could be used to  address  major 
land changes as part of a managed retreat strategy, County General Plan and Commu nity Plan updates 
provide important opportunities to address land use issues with rising seas at the local level. Revised and 
updated SMA policies, objectives, and requirements offer additional opportunities at the local level to 
prepare for sea level rise . Moreover, if the County of Maui chooses to recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone (one of the recommendations in Ch apter 5), it might be prudent  to 
consider adjusting SMA boundaries to coincide with the SLR -XA so tha t new subdivisions, commercial 
areas, hotels, and other development activities could undergo a higher level of review in light of sea level 
rise constraints. Figure 57 illustrates the partial overlap of SMA boundaries with the SLR -XA along portions 
of Ukumehame which is the southernmost settlement in the West Maui Community Plan region. It is a low -
density agricultural region  that still contains vacant undeveloped lots. The community is surrounded by 
fallow sugarcane fields and sig nificant cultural resources . The County may want to consider adjusting SMA 
boundaries to incorporate areas vulnerable to sea level rise throughout this region.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerabilit y zone in the County General 
Plan and Community Plan updates.  
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vulnerable urban areas with  preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands .  
 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR -XA, wherever possible, under a 
long-term comprehensive adaptation strategy . 
 Develop design standards to increase flood resiliency within the SLR -XA.

98 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOPLE AND PROPERTY  
People living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced when homes, condominiums, and 
business become flooded due to sea level rise. The potential number of people displaced is calculated by 
assigning an estimated occupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. Potential economic loss  in the 
SLR-XA is estimated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss estimates are assessed at 
the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids . The potential economic loss associated with flooded 
roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastructure is not accounted for in the assessment of 
economic impacts, and would add significant increases in losses.  
The potential number of displaced people  island -wide could rise from 730 residents with 1. 1 feet of sea 
level rise to over 1,590  residents with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (Figure 58). The people displaced would 
include a range of income levels and living arrangement s. In addition, both homeowners and renters are 
expected to be affected based on the housing census data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau for Census 
County Divisions (CCDs) (U.S. C ensus Bureau 2015d) . CCDs are areas delineated by the U.S. Census 
Bureau in cooperation with state, tribal, and local officials for statistical purposes. CCD boundaries usually 
follow visible features and usually coincide with Census Tract boundaries. For  the Island of  Maui, the island 
is divided into 11 CCDs: Ha‘ikū -Pa‘uwela, Hana, Kahului, Kīhei, Kula, Lahaina, Makawao -Paia, Pu‘unēnē, 
Spreckelsville, Waihe‘e -Waikapū, and Wailuku. In taking the average for the percentage of the occupied 
housing units that  are owner - and renter -occupied, approximately 58% are owner -occupied while 
approximately 42% are renter -occupied.  
Potential economic loss es (all structures and land)  island -wide would increase from an estimated $ 1.7 
billion with 1. 1 feet of sea level ris e to $ 3.2 billion with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (Figure 58). Approximately 
79% of the potential economic loss with 3.2 feet of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of residential 
structures and land. Th e potential economic loss across all sectors is associated with  approximately 760 
structures in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level  rise and approximately 3,130 acres of land . A number of 
the potentially flooded structures are hotels located in important visit or destination areas in West Maui as 
shown in Figure 59. 
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, potential economic loss would occur in low -lying coastal areas island -wide, 
with the greatest loss in West Maui  due to the c oncentration of high -value residential and commercial land 
and structures (Figure 60). Over time, as  sea level continues to rise, communities such as Lāhainā (Figure 
61) would experience increasing potent ial economic loss  as it serves as the region’s visitor, service, 
commercial, and residential center.   Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

 Require mandatory disclosure for vulnerable properties and consider acquisition to protect valuable 
coastal resources . 
 Seek opp ortunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
Sea level rise would result in significant impacts to roads, harbors, airports, electrical and 
telecommunication infrastructure, water/wastewater facilities and conveyance systems , and  other public 
service facilities (i.e.  schools, fire stations, police stations, medical facilities) on Maui.  Following the trends 
of private development, Maui ’s critical infrastructure is concentrated along low -lying shores and is highly  
vulnerable to flooding and erosion  in the SLR -XA. An estimated 5.1 miles of major  roads in Maui would be 
flooded in the SLR -XA with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise, increasing to 11.2 miles with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
(Figure 58). Portions of many coastal roads, such as  Honoapi ‘ilani Highway,  which connects West Maui 
and Central Maui, would become chronically flooded  (Figure 62). This could result in wide -spread regional 
issues such as loss of commerce, loss of access to emergency services and increased traffic on other 
roads and highways, some of which serve as the only access in and out of many communities. Electric and 
telecommunication transmission lines commonly follow roads and those located underground in the SLR -
XA may be impacted by sea level rise resulting in service disruptions.

104 Maui ’s three commercial harbors  and three a irports  are all located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise. The busiest and most significant facilities are located in Kahului in Central Maui ( Figure 63). According 
to the Maui Island Plan  (County of Maui 2012)  “all business activities on the island are eith er directly or 
indirectly dependent on operations at Kahului Harbor” (State of Hawai'i 2015) . More than 22,500 tons of 
cargo enter the island via the airport annually  (based on the amount of cargo that passed t hrough the 
harbors in 2014) (State of Hawai'i 2015) . Kahului Airport, the second busiest airport in the State , serves 
more than 6.2 million passengers a year . These critical transportation hubs and other critic al infrastructure  
would become increasingly exposed to chronic flooding from sea level rise. Further, i nterruption to 
interisland and transoceanic shipping and travel would impact residents, visitors, and all forms of economic 
activity.  
Island -wide, n o sch ools, fire stations, police stations,  or hospitals are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise ; however, the Wailuku -Kahului W astewater  Reclamation Facility may experience 
chronic flooding from 3.2 feet of sea level rise. A m ore detailed analyses of vulnerability and adaptation 
options for critical infrastructure are needed to evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocati on. 
State and County agencies should consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea leve l 
rise adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., flood proofing and relocating infrastructure sooner than 
later) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in place 
over the next 30 to 70 years.  
Please keep in mind that t he economic loss resulting from critical infrastructure was not estimated due to 
the complexity and uncertainties involved in design, siting, and construction  (Figure 58). However, i t should 
be noted that these costs could  be an order of magnitude greater than the potential economic lo sses 
estimated from  land and structure s.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provide for the economic self -sufficiency of Native Hawaiia ns 
through a homesteading program (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Home Lands include areas from mauka  to makai  (from the mountain to the sea). Coastal portio ns 
of Hawaiian Home Lands, such as in the East Maui communities of Ke’anae and Wailua  (Figure 64), would 
be flooded with sea level rise displacing Native Hawaiian families that live in this area. In addition, f ishing 
and cultural practices taking place along the shore would be impacted as beaches erode. In a recent study 
of multiple coastal hazards, 3 of the  11 Hawaiian Home Lands  homesteads  on Maui —Waiehu , Leiali’i , and 
Kahikinui —are estimated to have the greatest potential for pe ople to be displaced by tsunamis, waves, and 
sea level rise  (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) .  
In addition to Native Hawaiian communities, m any Native Hawaiian cultural and h istorical resources are 
located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosion already  threatens areas 
that have served as burial grounds, home sites, fish ponds, and other places  of cultural significance (Kane 
et al. 2012) . The number of cultural sites  on Maui  in the SLR -XA is projected to increase from 33 sites with 
1.1 feet of sea level rise , to 48 with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. This includes an unnamed resou rce located 
along the coast in Ke‘anae ( Figure 64).

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  COASTAL RESOURCES AN D PUBLIC ACCESS  
Maui ’s beaches play a critical role in recreation for our residents and Hawaii’s overa ll economy (Cristini et 
al. 2013) . Approximately 110 acres of public beaches and parks on Maui  are located within the SLR -XA 
with 3.2 feet of sea level rise . Many of these parks , such as Ho ‘okipa Beach Park ( Figure 65), are located 
on the seaward side of major roads, and demonstrate how lightly -developed parkland can provide a buffer 
between eroding shorelines and development for many decade s. Sea level rise will lead to extensive beach 
loss if widespread shoreline hardening is permitted and beach systems are not allowed to migrate landward. 
Many beaches on Maui, particularly along the north and southwest coasts, are backed by deposits of old er 
beach and dune sand (Sherrod et al. 2007)  which are crucial sources of sediment along eroding coasts. In 
a natural state, a beach can be maintained as it migrates landward if there is sufficient sand available i n 
the backshore to nourish the beach as it erodes. Shoreline hardening locks up this backshore sediment 
source leading to narrowing and loss of chronically eroding beaches.  
 
 
Kaho‘olawe  
Kaho‘olawe, part of Maui County, is the 8th largest island in Hawai‘i, with an area of 45 squa re miles. The 
island was not analyzed in this Report, largely due to the lack of built infrastructure and population upon 
which to conduct a vulnerability assessment. However, the island is home to significant natural and cultural 
resources which could be vulnerable to sea level rise which should be investigated further.  
The island is best known in recent history as “The Target Isle” for its use as a bombing range and other 
military training for half of the 20th century. Known also as the piko (navel, cent er) of the Hawaiian 
archipelago, the island has widespread cultural significance for fishing, voyaging and navigation. Owned by 
the State of Hawaiʻi, the island is managed by the Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC). Kaho‘olawe 
currently has no resi dent population, however KIRC volunteers, staff, and other visitors stay on the island in a 
cluster of buildings on the southeast coast at Honokanai‘a. Vegetation on the island is defined by the minimal 
rainfall the island receives, as well as the impact o f widespread former ranching on the island. KIRC works to 
restore native species on the island such as native grass planting in coastal dunes.  
Historically, the island has been home to modest settlement due to limited resources such as freshwater. 
Kaho‘ola we is designated as an Archeological District and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Many 
sacred places are found on the island, including heiau (shrines), ko‘a (fishing shrines), and locations of 
navigational significance. Kaho‘olawe is a tra ditional point of embarkation for voyaging canoes sailing to 
Tahiti and there is a navigational platform located right on the shoreline at the western -most point of the 
island, called Kealaikahiki (the road to Tahiti).  
Most of Kaho‘olawe’s coastline is roc ky with some sandy beaches located in protected bays. The island has 
experienced extensive land -based erosion due to the large populations of cattle, goats, and sheep that were 
ranched on the island in the 19th and 20th centuries. With 3.2 feet of sea leve l rise, some of the cultural sites 
and ecosystems on the coast are likely to be exposed to chronic flooding.

Figure 65. Potential chronic flooding of Ho‘okipa  Beach Park in the SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
along Maliko Bay , Maui  
A study of historical shoreline changes in Hawaiʻi by the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of 
Hawaiʻi (Fletcher et al. 2012)  found that 85% of Maui beaches are chronically eroding, the h ighest among 
the three islands studied (Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui). Over the past century, shoreline hardening was the 
typical response throughout Hawaiʻi when beachfront property was threatened by erosion or flooding. As a 
result, approximately 1 1 miles of Maui  beaches are backed by  seawalls and other shoreline hardening 
structures. Over 4 miles of beach fronting those structures ha ve already  been completely eroded away .  
Looking at the future, sea level rise presents a serious threat to Maui beach environme nts and public 
shoreline access. At present, 7 miles of beach remains with shoreline hardening on the backshore (11 miles 
minus the 4 already lost). These 7 miles of beach has a very high  risk of being inundated and eroded away 
in coming decades with sea l evel rise. With 1.1 feet of sea level rise, an additional 8 miles of unprotected 
beachfront development will be exposed to erosion and flooding (i.e. within the SLR -XA). These 8 miles 
include 4 miles of homes and buildings and 4 miles of coastal highway. W ith 3.2 feet of sea level rise, 16 
miles of unprotected beachfront development will be exposed to erosion and flooding, including 7 miles of 
homes and buildings, and 9 miles of roads. Beaches fronting these areas of exposed development face a 
high risk of loss if widespread shoreline  hardening  is allowed  rather than allowing beaches to migrate 
landward with sea level rise . As described in the Methods section, this analysis considers a scenario where 
widespread armoring is permitted and does not consider oth er adaptation scenarios such as managed 
retreat from impacted areas or beach nourishment, which could help extend the li fe of beaches such as 
Kā‘anapali. This analysis also does not account for effects of accelerated erosion that typically occurs 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
109 fronting and adjacent to coastal armoring, leading to more widespread impacts. More research is needed 
to improve the understandi ng and projections of localized vulnerability of beach and environments to the 
combined impacts of encroaching beachfront development and erosion and flooding with sea level rise.  
 
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats, vital to aquati c organisms and wildlife, would 
become flooded with sea level rise changing the nature of such  habitat s and the organisms that rely on 
them t. Estuarine habitats, where freshwater from rivers and streams, and saltwater from the sea meet and 
mix, would becom e increasingly marine with rising seas. This dynamic would impact areas such as  Kanahā 
Pond State Wildlife Sanctuary  (Aloha -Hawaii.com 2017) , which  provides habitat for endangered, native 
water birds ( Figure 66), that could potentially be altered by flooding as the sea level rises.  Hawaiian 
anchialin e pools , land-locked bodies of water of varying salinity that are adjacent to the ocean  (The Nature 
Conservancy 2012) , are occupied by small endemic red shrimp ( Halocaridina  and others) called ʻōpaeʻula 
and the  endangered shrimp, Procaris hawaiana  (Fish and Wildlife Service 2016) . These pools have 
indirect, underground connections to the sea, and show tid al fluctuations in water level. Other species,  
restricted to the surface w aters of the pools,  include a few fish species, crust aceans and other invertebrates.  
Two endangered waterbirds (Hawaiian Stilt and Hawaiian Coot), and several species  of migratory 
waterfowl also use these pools  (The Nature Conservancy 2012) .  Maui’s Erosion -based Shoreline Building Setbacks with Rising Seas  
As the State CZM program delegates authority to administer the CZM law to each  of the various counties, Maui County, 
through the Maui Planning Commission, has adopted an erosion -rate-based shoreline building setback rule (which holds 
the same power as a State Administrative Rule) . This shoreline building setback rule requires that a ll lots have a shoreline 
setback line that is the greater of the distances from the shoreline calculated by one of the following methods:  
1. Twenty -five feet plus a distance of 50 times the annual erosion hazard rate from the shoreline, or;  
2. Based on the lot’ s depth in the following table:  
Average Lot Depth  Setback Line  
Less than 100 feet  25 feet from the shoreline  
100 feet to 160 feet  40 feet from the shoreline  
Greater than 160 feet  25% of the average lot depth, but no more than 150 feet  
For irregularly s haped lots, or where cliff, bluffs, or other topographic features inhibit the safe measurement of the 
boundaries and/or the shoreline, the shoreline setback will be equivalent to 25% of the lot ’s depth (to be determined by 
the Planning Director) to a maxim um of 150 feet from the shoreline.  
This will help to protect Maui’s beaches and new development threatened by sea level rise. However, like the other 
islands, Maui faces the challenge of addressing increasing erosion and flooding impacts to older, existin g beachfront 
development sited without sufficient setbacks. While this ordinance will go a long way in the short -term to protect 
beaches and new development threatened by sea level rise, like the other islands, Maui faces the challenge of addressing 
potent ial erosion and flooding impacts to older, existing beachfront development sited without sufficient setbacks. In 
addition, erosion rates will accelerate with sea level rise. As depicted in this Report as the SLR -XA, chronic flooding due to 
sea level rise i s a composite of passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion.

Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. For example , on Maui where t here are approximately 100 OSDS 
within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise , 12 of those OSDS are located along Mā‘alaea Bay in 
Central Maui (Figure 67) which is in relatively close proximity  to Ke ālia Pond National Wildlife Refuge. This 
wildlife refuge is one of the few remaining natural wetlands on Maui and home to endangered wetland birds 
(U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2013) . The flooding of such systems in addition to septic ta nks, cesspools , 
and other hazardous materials storage  and disposal sites  could release wastewater or contaminants to 
nearshore waters.  The reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to determine if 
infrastructure of interest is located in the SLR -XA.

112 Challenges and Opportunities  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties located on or near Maui’s shorelines will increasingly be floo ded, 
eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Portions of coastal roads will also become flooded, eroded, impassible 
and irreparable, jeopardizing access to and from many communities. Maui’s famous beaches will 
increasingly be eroded and permanently lost if hard structures such as roads and seawalls impede their 
landward migration. The flooding of hotels and transportation systems, along with the loss of beaches, 
would impact the tourism economy and thus impact the people whose livelihoods depend on it.  
This Results section highlights just a few of t he very real challenges on Maui  with a scenario of 3.2 feet of 
sea level rise by the mid - to latter -part of the century. However,  sea level rise will not stop at the middle or 
end of the century. As highlighted th roughout this Report, higher sea level rise projections are considered 
“physically plausible ” by the end of the century based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le 
Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . While this Report models sea level  rise up to 3.2 feet, it should be noted 
that NOAA has modeled passive flooding scenarios with up to 6 feet of sea level rise in their Sea Level 
Rise Viewer (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from higher sea level scenarios, the 5 -foot 
passive flood layer from NOAA  was incorporated  into the vulnerability assessment which increa ses the 
area of the SLR -XA on Maui by 15 %. Figure 68 shows the potential extent of 5 feet of sea level rise in 
Kahului . While there is uncertainty over when the islands might experience such extreme sea level rise, the 
information provided illustrates the likely scenario of continued sea level rise over the next century.

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
113 Maui has opportunities to plan for sea level rise now by considering the recommendations for adaptation 
presented in Chapter 5 of this Report. Another threat that we will have to face in a world with climate change 
is increased coastal flooding from tropical storms, hurricanes, and  tsunamis. The added risk from event -
based coastal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report. However, these events 
pose a potential for loss of human life and property and for severe and long -term economic disruption. 
Communiti es should consider planning new development to reduce exposure from severe events by 
recognizing that the coastal floodplain will migrate landward with increased sea levels. Hazard mitigation 
and disaster recovery projects should be reviewed and revised to  address chronic and event -based flooding 
and consider the additive effects of accelerating sea level rise.

recognized that, in the rush to rebuild structures that were damaged in a storm or flood event, building  codes 
and coastal management priorities are often disregarded in favor of quick recovery. In response to that, the 
Planning Department led a planning process to develop a set of guidelines and protocols to build back 
“safer, stronger and smarter” after a damaging coastal event. To develop these tools, the Planning 
Department held a series of workshops in communities across the County to understand priorities for each 
community in rebuilding (County of Maui 2015b) . These workshops were intended to fulfill several 
objectives, including making communities more resilient to sea level rise.  
The Planning Department held community meetings in which participants weighed the costs and hazard s of 
rebuilding post -disaster in order to come up with a set of protocols for the County to employ post -disaster. 
The Planning Department compiled these protocols into a set of messages which they can release post -
disaster as public service announcements. These messages can guide landowners in what steps they need 
to take to recover from the damage incurred. This public guidance aims to minimize potentially harmful 
short -term solutions such as constructing a cement wall to protect beachfront property and in stead 
encourages long -term hazard mitigation and sea level rise adaption strategies. “So we don’t want to 
necessarily build back in the same site in the exact same way because we want to increase our resilience in 
our communities,” said Tara Owens, Coastal  Hazards Specialist with University of Hawai ʻi Sea Grant 
Program partnering with the Maui County Planning Department. Some strategies the Planning Department 
has identified for rebuilding to mitigate hazards to coastal structures are: retrofitting structural components, 
rebuilding to code, armoring (when appropriate), and elevating structures. Strategies to adapt to sea level 
rise include reconfiguring arrangement of structures on a plot, relocating structures or retreating, restoring 
beach ecosystems such as dunes, and demolishing or retiring struct ures where necessary.

Moloka‘i  
Moloka‘i , the State’s  fifth largest island , is known as the “f riendly isle.” For those who live there, they 
characterize the island as a mokupuni kuaʻāina , a country island , in both culture and geography (County of 
Maui 2001) . While the word kuaʻāina  translates literally as “back land” or “back country,” in the context of 
the Native Hawaiian cultural renaissance of the late twentieth century, kuaʻāina  refers to those who actively 
live Hawaiian culture and kept the spirit of the land alive.  
Kaunakakai located along the south coast, is the island’s major population and commercial center (County 
of Maui 2001) . The island is home to 6,958  residents (State of Hawai'i 2015)  accounting for less than 1 % 
of the State's population.  Moloka‘i is the second largest  island , in terms of population and land area , of the 
five islands (three inhabited)  that make up Maui  County. It should be noted that Kalaupapa, a peninsula on 
the north coast of Moloka‘i is a separate county, Kalawao County, and is not a part of Maui County. The 
population of Moloka‘i has grown by 32% over the last 50 years, but has not seen the population booms 
impacting other islands, such as Maui  (State of Hawai'i 2015) . Nonetheless, t his population growth  coupled  
with a growing tourism industry —almost 59,000 visitors came to Moloka‘i  in 201 6 (State of Hawai'i 2016)  
—has placed ever increasing demands on natural resources, critical infrastructure, and basic services.

115 Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, homes and businesses located near the shoreline will be impacted  by 
sea level rise. Over 400 structures would be chronically flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
 Of the 2,600 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, approximately 50% is designated as 
Conservation District lands.  
 With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, app roximately 2 miles of Molokai’s coastal roads would become 
impassible jeopardizing critical access to many communities.  
 A more detailed analysis of the vulnerability of Molokai’s critical infrastructure, including the 
Kalaupapa Airport and Kaunakakai Harb or, is needed. State and County agencies should consider 
potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as early as 
possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost of maintaining and 
repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in place over the next 30 to 70 years.  
This section provides a picture of the future of the Island of  Moloka‘i  with sea level rise and the potential 
impacts if no action is taken. The results are based o n modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise due to 
passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise, and depicts flood hazards that may occur in the mid - to latter -half of this century . This timeframe 
is within the expected lifespan of most new construction and much of our existing development. It should 
be noted that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible” by the end of the 
century, based on the late st climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . 
Vulnerability to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure 
to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Vulnerability is asse ssed in terms of potential impacts to land use, 
people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure (only land and structures are 
monetized, not infrastructure).  
The reade r is urged to exercise caution in interpreting the results , which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as future societal choices which cannot be 
known t oday. Further, the reader should also visit the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore  the full 
extent of the vulnerability maps for each island.  
Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from exposure to passive flooding with sea level 
rise. For the purposes of exposure and planning, we focus mainly on a scenario with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying coastal areas around the island within the SLR -XA may become 
chronically flooded within the mid - to latter - half of this century ( Figure 69). This land will be submerged by 
coastal erosion, direct marine flooding from tides  and waves, or become new wetlands behind the shoreline 
from rising water tables and reduced drainage. Approximately 2,590 acres of land are estimated to be in Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
116 the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Some examples of areas that would be exposed to chro nic 
flooding include Mo‘omomi , Kalaupapa , Hale o Lono Harbor , and Kapa ‘akea  as illustrated on Figure 70. 
These areas include a wide variety of communities and assets such as p ortions of the Mo‘omomi Preserve , 
which is l ocated in n orthwest Moloka‘i and home to rare native and endangered species; the Kalaupapa 
Peninsula, which includes the Kalaupapa National Historic Park and the administratively distinct settlement 
of Kalawao; Hale o Lono Harbor, a manmade harbor on the southwestern  coast of the island that hosts two 
annual outrigger canoe competitions; and Kapa ‘akea , a Hawaiian Homelands community near Kaunakakai. 
These areas would all become flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
Over time, as sea level continues to rise, low -lying, populated coastal communities such as Kapa ‘akea  
would experience increased frequency and severity of flooding ultimately leading to permanent inundation , 
making some areas of the coast impassable or uninhabitable  (Figure 71). Decisions about where to use 
coastal armoring and when to retreat will need to be made carefully. It should be noted that seawalls may 
not be effective at preventing flooding with sea level rise in many low -lying areas as rising groundwater can 
infiltrate  through porous geology. While specific responses to sea level rise will need to be place -based, 
larger regional issues should be considered, such as whether to armor in place or whether to relocate roads 
and other critical infrastructure inland. In the ca se of  Kapa ‘akea  where there may be opportunities to 
consider a managed retreat strategy as there are ample vacant lands immediately mauka  (landward)  and 
outside of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, as discussed in the Recommendations 
Chapter of this Report (Chapter 5), and as with  other populated coastal areas with adjacent vacant  lands, 
large -scale boundary amendments should be predicated on appropriate state policies and guidelines (e.g., 
within Chapter 205, State Land Use Act) to provi de the supportive legal basis for major land use changes.

120 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
While sea level rise would result in impacts within the State U rban, Rural, A gricultural, and C onservation 
Land Use Districts  around the island, Conservation  District lands  would experience the greatest extent of 
chronic flooding (Figure 72). More than 51 % of the 2,590  acres in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
is designated as Conservation District land while only approximately 8% of the land located within the SLR -
XA is located in the Urban Distr ict. However, considering that currently only about 2% of Molokai ’s 165,800  
acres  is located in an Urban Land Use District (State of Hawai'i 2015) , it can be expected that new Urban 
District land would need to be designated to accommodate (re)development away from the shoreline.  
While the State Land Use District Boundary Amendment process could be used to sort out major land 
changes as part of a managed retreat strategy, County General Plan and Community Plan u pdates provide  
important opportunities to address land use issues w ith rising seas  at the local level. Revised and updated 
SMA policies, objectives, and requirements offer additional opportunities at the local level to prepare for 
sea level rise. Moreover,  if the County of Maui  chooses to recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise as a vulnerability zone (one of the recommendations in Ch apter 5), it might be prudent  to consider 
adjusting SMA boundaries to coincide with the SLR -XA so that new subdi visions, commercial areas, hotels, 
and other development activities could undergo a higher level of review in light of sea level rise constraints. 
Figure 73 illustrates the partial overlap of SMA boundaries with the SLR -XA near Kamalō located on the 
southeast side of Moloka‘i . 
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone in the County 
General Plan and Community Plan updates . 
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vul nerable urban areas with preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR -XA, wherever possible, under a 
long-term comprehensive adaptation strategy.  
 Develop design standards to increase floo d resiliency within the SLR -XA.

122 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOPLE AND PROPERTY  
People living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced wh en homes, condominiums, and 
businesses become flooded due to sea level rise. The potential number of people displaced is calculated 
by assigning an estimated occupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. Potential economic loss  in 
the SLR -XA is estim ated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss estimates are assessed 
at the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids. The potential economic loss associated with flooded 
roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastr ucture is not accounted for and would add 
significant increases in losses.  
The potential number of displaced people  island -wide could rise from around 10 residents with 1. 1 feet of 
sea level rise , to over 550 residents with 3.2 feet of sea level rise  (Figure 74). The people displaced would 
include a range of income levels and living arrangements. In addition, both homeowners and renters are 
expected to be affected based on the housing census data provided by the CCDs. CCDs are are as 
delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with state, tribal, and local officials for statistical 
purposes. CCD boundaries usually follow visible features and usually coincide with Census Tract 
boundaries. For Moloka‘i, the island is divided i nto three CCDs: East Moloka‘i, West Moloka‘i CCD, and 
Kalawa. In taking the average for the percentage of the occupied housing units that are owner - and renter -
occupied, 44% are owner -occupied while 56% are renter -occupied.  
Potential economic loss es (all structures and land) island -wide would increase from an estimated $ 131 
million with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise , to $285 million with 3.2 feet of sea level rise  (Figure 74). Approximately 
65% of the potential economic loss with 3.2  feet of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of residential 
structures and land. Th e potential economic loss  across all sectors  is associated with approximately 780 
structures in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level  rise and approximately 2,590 acres  of land . 
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, potential economic loss would occur in low -lying coastal areas island -wide, 
with the greatest loss along the southern shore between Kaunakakai and Kamalō due to the concentration 
of residential and commercial land  and structures  in these areas  (Figure 75). Over time, as the sea level 
continues to rise, communities such as Kaunakakai and Kapa‘akea  (Figure 76), would experience 
increasing potential economic loss.   Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vu lnerability and Adaptation Report  
123 RECOMMENDATION HIGHLI GHTS  
 Require mandatory disclosure for vulnerable properties and consider acquisition to protect 
valuable coastal resources . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise under a l ong-term, comprehensive adaptation strategy . 
 Develop design standards to increase  flood resiliency for existing and new development within 
the SLR -XA that cannot be relocated.  
 Develop a multi -pronged f inancing  strategy at federal, state, county, private se ctor, and 
philanthropic levels to address costs of adaptation to sea level rise .

126 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
Sea level rise would result in significant impacts to roads, airports, harbors, electrical and 
telecommunication infrastructure, water/wastewater facilities and conveyance systems , and other public 
servic e facilities (i.e.  schools, fire stations, police stations, medical facilities) on Moloka‘i. Following the 
trends of private development, much of Molokai ’s critical public infrastructure is concentrated on low -lying 
shores and is highly  vulnerable to flood ing in the SLR -XA. No major roads  would be flooded in the SLR -XA 
with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise ; however,  more than 2 miles  would be flooded  with 3.2 feet of sea level rise  
(Figure 74). Portions of many coastal roads, such as Kamehameha V Highway, would  become chronically 
flooded ( Figure 77) and result in regional issues such as loss of commerce, loss of access to emergency 
services, and increased traffic on other roads and highways, some of which, serve as the only access in 
and out of many communities and inundation could result in isolation. As there are a limited number of 
roads on Moloka‘i, with only about 124 miles of paved roads, even limited flooding could have significant 
impacts.  Electric and tel ecommunication transmission lines commonly follow roads and those located 
underground in the SLR -XA may be impacted by sea level rise resulting in service disruptions.  
Moloka‘i  has two small airports , Moloka ‘i Airport located in the central plateau and  Kalaupapa Airport 
located on the Kalaupapa Peninsula. These two airports are critical points of entry for people and goods to 
Moloka‘i . In 201 4, the Moloka‘i  Airport served 119,981  passengers and handled 825 tons of incoming cargo, 
while the Kalaupapa Airport  served 6,408 passengers and handled 92 tons of incoming cargo  (State of 
Hawai'i 2015) . While Moloka‘i  Airport is located on high ground away from the shore and would not be 
impacted by sea level rise , Kalaupap a Airport  is located on lower ground near the coast (Figure 78) and 
portions of the airport would be located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise . The main harbor 
on Moloka‘i, Kaunakakai Harbor, is use d for cargo, recreation, and commercial purposes and would 
experience chronic flooding as a result of 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Interruption to interisland shipping and 
travel would impact residents, visitors, and economic activity.  
No schools, fire sta tions, police stations, or hospitals are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise , however, the Kaunakakai W astewater Treatment Plant is located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise.  When flooded , this facility has the potenti al to release wastewater or contaminants to 
nearshore waters.  More detailed analyses of vulnerability and adaptation options for critical infrastructure 
are needed to evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocation . State and County agencies  
should consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as 
early as possible (e.g., flood proofing and relocating infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost 
of maintaining and repairing chronically t hreatened public infrastructure in p lace over the next 30 to 70 
years.  The reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to determine if any infrastructure 
or public facilities of  interest are located within the SLR -XA. 
Please keep in mind that infrastructure losses have not been monetized. However, i t should be noted that 
these costs could  be an order of magnitude greater than the potential economic lo sses estimated from  land 
and structure s.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vu lnerability and Adaptation Report  
127 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Conduct in -depth vulnerability assessments and evaluation of adaptation strategies for existing 
critical infrastructure througho ut the County.  
 Consider long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures now (e.g., 
major flood proofing or relocation) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically 
threatened public infrastructure over the next 30  to 70 years.  
 Require the design and siting of new development and capital improvement projects to include 
an in -depth analysis of sea level rise impacts based on elevation, tolerance for risk, and lifetime 
of the structure.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provi de for the economic self -sufficiency of Native Hawaiians 
through a homesteading program (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Ho me Lands include areas from mauka  to makai  (from the mountain to the sea ). Coastal portions 
of Hawaiian Home Lands, such as in Kalama ‘ula (Figure 79), would be flooded with sea level rise displacing 
Native Hawaiian families that l ive in this areas. In addition, fishing and cultural practices taking place along 
the shore would be impacted as beaches erode. In a recent study of multiple coastal hazards, four of the 
six Hawaiian Home Lands on Moloka‘i , Kamiloloa -Makakupa ‘ia (assessed together due to proximate 
geography ), Ho‘olehua -Pālā‘au, and Kalama‘ula, are estimated to have the greatest potential for people to 
be displaced by tsunamis, waves, and sea level rise (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . 
In addition to Native Hawaiian communities themselves, m any Native Hawaiian cultural and historical 
resources are located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosion already  
threatens  areas that have served as burial grounds, home sites, fishponds, and other places  of cultural 
significance (Kane et al. 2012) . The number of cultural sites  on Moloka‘ i in the SLR -XA is p rojected to 
increase from 17 sites with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise , to 26 with 3.2 feet of sea level rise . This includes 
cultural sites on Lā‘au Point that may be flooded as a result of sea level rise  (Figure 80). Rising seas would 
also impact  the many loko i ‘a (ancient Hawaiian fishponds) located on Moloka‘i .  
 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vu lnerability and Adaptation Report  
130 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Develop an inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural resources and  practices that may be impacted by 
sea level rise . 
 Work with Native Hawaiian communi ties to determine steps they want to take regarding climate 
impacts.  
 Develop adaptation plans  to preserve access to coastal land and water within  Native Hawaiian 
communities .

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  COASTAL RESOURCES AN D PUBLIC ACCESS  
Molokai ’s beaches play a critical role in recreation for residents and Hawaii’s overall economy (Cristini et  
al. 2013) . An assessment of public beaches and parks was not conducted for Moloka‘i because of a lack 
of available GIS data; however, public parks located near the coast, such as Papohaku Beach Park, 
Mālama Cultural Park, Duke Maliu Regional Park, One Ali‘i Beach Park, Kakahai‘a Beach Park, and H ālawa 
Beach Park, may be impacted by 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Some public beaches , such as Kepuhi Beach 
(Figure 81), are located on  the seaward side of major roads, and demonstrate how lightly -developed 
parkland can provide a buffer between eroding shorelines and development for many decades.  
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats, vital to aquatic organisms and wi ldlife would 
become flooded with sea level rise, changing the nature of such habitat s and the organisms that rely on 
them . Estuarine habitats, where freshwater from rivers and streams, and saltwater from the sea meet and 
mix, would become increasingly mari ne with rising seas. This dynamic would impact areas such as Hālawa 
Beach Park , on the eastern shore of Moloka‘i,  where water from the Hālawa Stream mix es with ocean 
waters  (Figure 82). Some of the earliest known settlements in Ha wai‘i are located in H ālawa Valley and 
remnants of irrigation systems supporting taro cultivation remain (County of Maui 2 001). Hawaiian 
anchialine pools , land-locked bodies of water of varying salinity that are adjacent to the ocean  (The Nature 
Conservancy 2012) , are occupied by small endemic red shrimp ( Halocaridina  and others) called ʻōpaeʻula 
and the  endangered shrimp, Procaris hawaiana  (Fish and Wildlife Servi ce 2016) . These pools have 
indirect, underground connections to the sea, and show tid al fluctuations in water level. Other species,  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vu lnerability and Adaptation Report  
132 restricted to the surface waters of the pools,  include a few fish species, crust aceans and other invertebrates.  
Two endange red waterbirds (Hawaiian Stilt and Hawaiian Coot), and several species  of migratory 
waterfowl also use these pools  (The Nature Conservancy 2012) .  
Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. Septic ta nks, cesspools and other OSD S, as well as hazardous 
materials storage  and disposal sites could become flooded and release wastewater or contaminants to 
nearshore waters. OSDS are of particular concern for  Moloka ‘i as island -wide t here are approximately 131 
OSDS within the SLR -XA with  3.2 feet of sea level rise. Puko’o , located on the east shore of the island, is 
a good example of an area where the release of wastewater or contaminants from OSDS could impact  
nearshore waters and  several fishponds ( Figure 83). 
 
 
 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Amend the State Legacy Lands Act to set aside funding for preserving priority coastal lands and 
use of a variety of practices and tools to enable legacy beaches to persist.  
 Develop shoreline conservation and restoration priorities  and guidelines to support adaptation to 
sea level rise.  
 Expand the area of national, state, and county parks and wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian 
Islands to preserve wetlands and wildlife.  
 Protect nearshore water quality by identifying hazard mitigat ion measures to address coastal 
flooding of hazardous material/waste storage facilities and OSDSs vulnerable to sea level rise.

Challenges and Opportunities  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties locat ed on or near Molokai’s shorelines will increasingly be flooded, 
eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Portions of coastal roads will also become flooded, eroded, impassible 
and irreparable, jeopardizing access to and from many communities. Beaches will i ncreasingly be eroded 
and permanently lost if hard structures such as roads and seawalls impede their landward migration.  
This Results section highlights just a few of the very real challenges on Moloka‘i with a scenario of 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise by t he mid - to the latter -part of the century. Sea level rise will not stop at the middle or end 
of the century. As highlighted throughout this Report, higher sea level rise projections are considered 
“physically plausible ” by the end of the century based on t he latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le 
Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . While this Report models sea level rise up to 3.2 feet, it should be noted 
that NOAA has model ed passive flooding  scenarios with up to  6 feet of sea level rise  in their Sea Level 
Rise Viewer  (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from higher sea level scenarios, the 5-foot 
passive  flood layer  from NOAA was incorporated into the vulnerability assessment which increases the 
area of the SLR -XA of Moloka‘i by 29%. Figure 84 shows the potential extent of 5 feet of p assive flooding 
with sea level rise for the communities of Kaunakakai, Kekaha, and Kapa‘akea.  While there is uncertainty 
over when the islands might experience such extreme sea level rise, the information is provided merely to 
remind readers that sea level  rise is going to continue for the remainder of the century and beyond.

and Kapa ʻakea on Moloka ʻi 
Regardless, these un certainties should catalyze not paralyze action. With abundant land outside of the 
SLR-XA, Moloka ‘i has opportunities to plan for sea level rise now by considering County General Plan and 
Community Plan updates that recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of se a level rise as a vulnerability zone 
and to plan for future land use now. In addition to chronic coastal flooding from sea level rise, tropical 
storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis create waves that flood low -lying coastal areas. The added risk from 
event -base d coastal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report. However, these 
events pose a potential for loss of human life and property, and for severe and long -term economic 
disruption. Communities should consider planning new developm ent to reduce exposure from severe

Protecting Molokai’s Fishponds  
WEAVING TRADITIONAL VALUES AND MODERN CL IMATE SCIENCE TO PRO TECT MOLOKAI’S 
FISHPONDS AND OTHER VALUED RESOURCES  
“I think what bro ught us to this point was that we were starting to observe changes and our kupuna were 
starting to observe changes to the landscape,” said Kauwila Hanchett, Co -Executive Director of Ka Honua 
Momona (KHM), a nonprofit founded to restore and care for two 15t h century, traditional fishponds on 
Moloka‘i. “We’d been hearing this buzz about climate change but we recognized that we didn’t know a lot 
about it.”  
It was the threat of changes to the fishponds as well as the natural and cultural resources on Moloka‘i that 
inspired KHM to apply for a grant from the Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative (PICCC). This grant 
funded workshops and other projects aimed at bridging traditional values and practices with modern climate 
science.  
Though KHM’s focus is on coas tal issues that would impact fishponds, such as coastal erosion and 
changing rain patterns and runoff, the group is concerned with the whole spectrum of climate impacts. “Part 
of our whole approach is looking at the ahupua‘a [watershed] as a whole, the isl and as a whole,” said 
Hanchett. By looking at all the potential impacts to the whole island ecosystem, the community can 
determine how climate change could impact their way of life and the resources on which it depends. One of 
the Task Force’s first priori ties is to improve education on Moloka‘i about these potential lifestyle changes to 
Molokai’s subsistence lifestyle and connection to more traditional Hawaiian practices.  
The workshops were so successful that the attendees decided to form an “Interim Task Force ” continuing 
the climate change conversation at a grassroots level. “The dialogue was really rich. We felt like it was too 
precious to have that end,” said Hanchett. The group made a list of action items to pursue, including holding 
climate science tr ainings, collecting local data points such as rain gauge measurements, and documenting 
landscape change through historical photographs. Those on Moloka‘i have tried to meet monthly since then 
to continue their work to increase awareness within the Moloka‘i  community about climate change. The 
visiting scientists have continued to provide support and several returned to present at a recent community 
meeting.

Lāna‘i   
The Island of  Lāna‘i, the State’s  smallest publicly accessible inhabited island , is also known as the  
“Pineapple  Island” due to its past as an island -wide pineapple plantation.  Lāna‘i is a  part of Maui County 
and is home to 3,526  residents (State of Hawai'i 2015) , accounting for  only 0.2% of the State's population.  
While t he population has grown by 31% since 1970, it has not seen the population booms impacting other 
islands, such as Maui. Nonetheless, this population growth coupled with a growing tourism industry —over 
63,000  visitors came to Lāna‘i in 2016  (State of Hawai'i 2016) —has placed ever increasing demands on 
natural resources, critical infrastructure, and basic services.  It should be noted that maj ority of the 
population and the primary commerce center on Lāna‘i is located in the center of the island at higher 
elevations. Due to this and the rural nature of the island, Lāna‘i has significantly less development exposed 
to sea level rise impacts compa red to the other islands in the State. However, sea level rise will still have 
impacts on the people, economy , and environment of Lāna‘i.  
Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, structures  located near the shoreline will be impacted by sea level 
rise. Around a dozen structures would be chronically flooded by 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
 Of the 380 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, over 50% is designated as Conservation 
District lands.  
 A more detailed analysis of the vulnerability of Lānai’s cri tical infrastructure, including Kaumālapa‘u 
Harbor, is needed. State and County agencies should consider potential long -term cost savings

138 from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., relocating 
infrastructure sooner than l ater) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically 
threatened public infrastructure in place over the next 30 to 70 years.  
This section provides a picture of the future of the Island of  Lāna‘i  with sea level rise and the potential 
impacts if no action is taken. The results are based on modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise due to 
passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise, and depicts flood hazards that may oc cur in the mid - to latter -half of this century. This timeframe 
is within the expected lifespan of most new construction and much of our existing development. It should 
be noted that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible ” by the end of the 
century, based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . 
Vulnerability to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure 
to coastal haz ards and sea level rise. Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, 
people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure (only land and structures are 
monetized, not infrastructure).  
The reade r is urged t o exercise caution in interpreting the results, which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as f uture societal choices which cannot be 
known today. Further, as not all parts of the island can be shown in detail, the reader should also visit the 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore the full ext ent of the vulnerability maps for each island.  
Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from exposure to passive flooding with sea level 
rise. For the purposes of exposure and planning,  we focus mainly on a scenario with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying coastal areas around the island within the SLR -XA may become 
chronically flooded within the mid - to latter -half of this century ( Figure 85). This land will become submerged 
by coastal erosion, direct marine flooding from tides and waves, or become new wetlands behind the 
shoreline from rising water tables and reduced drainage. Approximately 380 acres of land on Lāna‘i are 
estimated to be located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. As mentioned previously, the 
topography and development patterns of Lāna‘i lend themselves to less exposure to the impacts of sea 
level rise than the other islands in the State. However, o ver time, as the sea level continues to rise, low -
lying, economically important areas, such as Hulopo ‘e Bay and Mānele Bay ( Figure 86), woul d experience 
increased frequency and extent of flooding. Decisions about where to use coas tal armoring and when to 
retreat will need to be made carefully. It should be noted that seawalls may not be effective at preventing 
flooding with sea level rise in some low -lying areas as rising groundwater can infiltrate through porous 
geology in low -lying areas. While specific responses to sea level rise would need to be place -based, larger 
regional issues should also be considered, such as whether to armor in place or whether to relocate 
vulnerable development inland.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

141 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
Sea level rise would result in impacts within the State U rban, Rural, Agricultural, and Conservation  Land 
Use Districts around the island, however, C onservation  District lands  would exper ience the greatest extent 
of chronic flooding (Figure 87). More than half of the 380 acres of land located within the SLR -XA are 
designated as Conservation lands  while only  approximately 16% of the 380 acres of land located within  the 
SLR-XA are within the Urban District. However, it should be noted that only approximately 2% of Lanai’s 
89,920 acres are located in either the Urban or Rural District which coincides with the rural nature of the 
island and the fact that the majority o f the population and businesses are concentrated in Lāna‘i City, on 
the central plateau. Therefore, impacts from sea level rise on areas with concentrated development would 
be less significant on Lāna‘i than on other islands in the State. There are , howeve r, a number of Urban 
designated lands along the coast, especially along the western and southern shore of the island around 
Kaumalapau Harbor and Mānele, that are within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. In instances 
such as these, there may be s ome pressure to convert existing Conservation District or Rural lands to 
Urban designated lands to accommodate redevelopment away from the shoreline.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone in the County General 
Plan and Community Plan updates.  
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vulnerable urban areas with preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise under a long -term, comprehensive adaptation  strategy.

142 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOP LE AND PROPERTY  
Across the State, people living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced when homes, 
condominiums, and business become flooded due to sea level rise. The potential number of people 
displaced is estimated by assigning an estimated o ccupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. 
Potential economic loss  in the SLR -XA is estimated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss 
estimates are assessed at the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids. The potential econ omic 
loss associated with flooded roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastructure is not 
accounted for in the assessment of economic impacts, and would add significant increases in losses.  
No residents  island -wide are expected to be directly d isplaced by 3.2 feet of sea level rise; h owever, 
residents could  be displaced due to economic impacts on major employers , such as the Four Seasons 
Resort , or from the loss of lands associated with their homes. P otential economic loss es (all struc tures and 
land) island -wide would increase from an estimated $ 9 million with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise to $ 10 million  
with 3.2 feet of sea level rise ( Figure 88). Approximately 11% of the potential economic loss with 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of residential land. This potential economic loss is associated with 
approximately 13 structures in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level  rise and approximately 380 acres of 
land. 
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, po tential economic loss would occur in low -lying coastal areas, with the 
greatest loss along the southern shore , around Mānele and Hulopoʻe Bays,  due to the commercial land and 
harbor facilities  (Figure 89 and Figure 90).  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Require mandatory disclosure for vulnerable  properties and consider acquisition to protect valuable 
coastal resources.  
 Develop design standards to increase  flood resiliency for existing and new development within the 
SLR-XA that cannot be relocated.  
 Seek opportunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise under a long -term, comprehensive adaptation strategy . 
 Develop a multi -pronged financing  strategy at federal, state, county, private sector, and 
philanthropic levels to address costs of adaptation to sea level rise .

146 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
As with most development  on the island , most of Lānai ’s critical infrastructure is located outside of the 
projected flooding area in the SLR -XA. While s ea level rise  would result in a few notable imp acts to coastal 
roads , no major  roads would be flooded in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise . 
Lāna‘i  has one airport and two harbors.  The Lāna‘i A irport is located at higher elevations and outside of 
areas likely to be flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, the principal commercial harbor, 
Kaumālapa ‘u Harbor (Figure 91), and M ānele Small Boat Harbor would become increasingly exposed to 
chronic flooding from sea level rise . Interruption to interisl and shipping and travel would impact residents, 
visitors, and all forms of economic activity. No schools, fire stations, police stations, hospitals, or wastewater 
treatment plants are located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. A m ore detailed a nalyses of  
vulnerability and adaptation options for critical infrastructure, particularly the harbor facilities, is needed to 
evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocation.  
Please keep in mind that t he economic loss resulting from critica l infrastructure was not estimated due to 
the complexity and uncertaint y involved in design, siting, and construction  (Figure 88). However, it  should 
be noted that these costs could  be an order of magnitude greater than the potent ial economic lo sses 
estimated from  land and structure s. 
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 State and County agencies should consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing 
sea level rise adaption measures as early as possible (e.g., flood proofing and r elocating 
infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically 
threatened public infrastructure in place over the next 30 to 70 years.  
 Require the design and siting of new development and capital improvement proj ects to include an 
in-depth analysis of sea level rise impacts based on elevation, tolerance for risk, and lifetime of the 
structure .

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provide for the economic self -sufficiency of Native Hawaiians 
through a  homesteading program (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Home Lands include areas from mauka to makai  (from the mountain to t he sea). While there is a 
section of Hawaiian Home Lands located in Lāna‘i City, there are no coastal Hawaiian Home Lands ( Figure 
92) that could be flooded due to sea level rise. However, fishing and cultural pract ices taking place along 
the shore may be impacted as beaches erode.  
Just as important as the Native Hawaiian communities themselves, m any Native Hawaiian cultural 
resources are located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosio n already  
threatens areas that have served as burial grounds, home sites, fishponds, and other places  of cultural 
significance (Kane et al. 2012) . The number of cultural sites  on Lāna‘i  in the SLR-XA is projected to increase 
from 33 sites with 1. 1 feet of sea level rise , to 34 with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  For example, t he Kalamanui 
Complex , a small historic settlement area (County of Maui 2015a)  north of Kaumālapa‘u , may be flooded 
as a result of sea level rise  (Figure 93).   
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
148 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Develop an inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices impacted by sea level 
rise. 
 Work with Native Hawaiian comm unities to determine steps they want to take regarding climate 
impacts.  
 Develop adaption plans to preserve access to coastal land and water within Native Hawaiian 
communities.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  COASTAL RESOURCES AND PUBLIC ACCESS  
While b eaches play a critical role in recreation for residents and Hawaii’s  overall  economy (Cristini et al. 
2013) , no public beach parks (inclusi ve of city, state , and federal parks) on Lāna‘i  are located in the SLR -
XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, p ublic beaches , such as at Hulopoʻe Bay ( Figure 86), could  be 
lost if structures or terrain stop beaches from migr ating landward as the sea level rises.   
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats, vital to aquatic organisms and wildlife would 
become flooded with sea level rise, changing the nature of such habitat s and the organisms that rely on 
them . Due to the island’s lack of perennial stre ams, Lāna‘i  does not have many estuarine habitats or coastal 
wetland areas that could be flooded by the SLR -XA. However, future flooding may create new coastal 
wetlands in low -lying areas and impact existing fishponds on the island, including the Ka‘a Fish pond on  the 
northeastern shoreline of the island ( Figure 94). 
Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. Septic ta nks, cesspo ols and other OSDS, as well as hazardous 
materials storage  and disposal sites  could become flooded and release wastewater or contaminants to 
nearshore waters. While O SDS are commonly located along more rural areas of shoreline , data to assess 
the number of  OSDS that would be flooded on Lāna‘i  was not available.  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
150 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Amend the State Legacy Lands Act to set aside funding for preserving priority coastal lands and 
use of a variety of practices and tools to enable legacy beaches to persist.  
 Develop shoreline conservation and restoration priorities and guidelines to support adaptation to 
sea level rise.  
 Expand the area of national, state, and county parks and wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian 
Islands to preserve wetlands and wildlife.  
 Protect nearshore water quality by identifying hazard mitigation measures to address coastal 
flooding of hazardous material/waste storage facilities and OSDSs vulnerable to sea level rise.

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
151 Challenges and Opportunities  
The impacts of sea level rise on the island of Lāna‘i are less severe than the impacts projected for the other 
islands given the island’ s development patterns and terrain. Even so, several structures and properties 
along the coast would be vulnerable to chronic and event -based flooding due to sea level rise, which could 
have significant impacts ranging from loss of beach access for recreat ional and cultural use, to interruption 
of interisland shipping through Lānai’s two harbors.  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties located on or near Lāna i’s shorelines will increasingly be flooded, 
eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Beaches, like H ulopoʻe, will increasingly be eroded and may be 
permanently lost if structures or terrain impede their landward migration. Impacts to harbors and coastal 
resort facilities, including potential loss of beaches, would impact the tourism economy and thus impa ct the 
people whose livelihoods depend on it.  
This Results section highlights just a few of t he challenges on Lānaʻi with a scenario of 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise by the mid - to latter -part of the century. However, sea level rise will not stop at the midd le or end of the 
century. As highlighted throughout this Report, higher sea level rise projections are considered “physically 
plausible ” by the end of the century based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, 
Drijfhout, and de Vries  2017) . While this Report models sea level rise up to 3.2 feet, it should be noted that 
NOAA has modeled passive flooding scenarios with up to 6 feet of sea level rise in their Sea Level Rise 
Viewer (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from higher sea level scenarios, the 5 -foot passive 
flood layer from NOAA was incorporat ed into the vulnerability assessment  which increa ses the area of the 
SLR-XA on Lāna'i by 29%. While there is uncertainty over when the islands might experience such extreme 
sea level rise, the information provided illustrate s the likely scenario of continu ed sea level rise  over the  
next century.  
With abundant land outside of the SLR -XA, Lāna‘i has opportunities to plan for sea level rise now by 
considering the recommendations for adaptation presented in Chapter 5 of this Report. Another threat that 
we will have to face in a world with climate change is increased coastal flooding from tropical storms, 
hurricanes, and tsunamis. The added risk from event -based coastal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise 
is not included in this Report. However, these events p ose a potential for loss of human life and property 
and for severe and long -term economic disruption. Communities should consider planning new 
development to reduce exposure from severe events by recognizing that the coastal floodplain will migrate 
landwar d with increased sea level rise. Hazard mitigation and disaster recovery projects should be reviewed 
and revised to address chronic and event -based flooding and consider the additive effects of accelerating 
sea level rise.  Hawai‘i Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

O‘ahu  
The Island of  O‘ahu  has appropriately been nicknamed the  “Gathering Place”  within the Hawaiian Island 
archipelago.  It is home to the city of Honolulu, which is the State’s most populous city and serves as the 
State’s Capitol. W ith 998,714 residents (State of Hawai'i 2015) , O‘ahu  account s for 70% of the State's 
population.  A doubling of Oahu’s population  over the last 50 years coupled with a growing tourism 
industry —over 5.4 million visitors came to O‘ahu in 201 6 (State of Hawai'i 2016) —has placed ever 
increasing demand s on Oahu’s housing market,  natural resources, critical infrastructure , and basic 
services. Many of these resources and services are at significant risk from flooding and erosion damage 
from sea level rise.  Thus, a major impact from sea level rise on O‘ahu can easily reverberate and  translate 
into major economic and social impacts for the neighbor islands.  
Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, homes and businesses on Oahu’s shorelines will be severely 
impacted by sea level rise. Nearly 4,000 structures would be chronically fl ooded with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise.  
 Of the 9,400 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, over half is designated for Urban land uses, 
making O‘ahu the most vulnerable of all the islands.  
Mapunapuna, Honolulu , Oahu  
Source: Dolan Eversole  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
153  With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, almost 18 miles of Oahu’s coast al roads would become impassible, 
jeopardizing access to and from many communities.  
 Oʻahu has lost more than 5 miles of beaches to coastal erosion fronting seawalls and other 
shoreline armoring. Many more miles of beach could be lost with sea level rise, i f widespread 
armoring is allowed.  Chapter 5 (Recommendations) explores opportunities to reduce beach loss by 
improving beach protection policies.  
 A more detailed economic loss analysis is needed of Oahu’s critical infrastructure, including harbor 
faciliti es, airport facilities, sewage treatment plants, and roads. State and County agencies should 
consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as 
early as possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than late r) compared to the cost of 
maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in place over the next 30 to 70 
years . 
This section provides a picture of the future of the Island of  O‘ahu with sea level rise and the potential 
impacts  from chronic flooding. The results are based on modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise due 
to passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise, and depicts flood hazards that may occur in the mid - to latter -half of this century. This timeframe 
is within the expected lifespan of most new construction and much of our existing development. It should 
be noted that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible” by  the end of the 
century, based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . 
Vulnerability to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure 
to coastal hazards  and sea level rise. Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, 
people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure (only land and structures are 
monetized, not infrastructure).  
The reade r is urged to ex ercise caution in interpreting the results, which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as futur e societal choice s which cannot be 
known today. Further,  the reader  should visit the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore  the full extent 
of the vulnerability maps for each island.  
Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from exposure to passive flooding with sea level 
rise. For the purposes of exposure and planning, we focus mainly on a scenario with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying coastal areas around the island within the SLR -XA may become 
chronically flooded within the mid- to latter -half of this century (Figure 95). This land will become submerged 
as a result of coastal erosion, coastal flooding from tides and waves, or become new wetlands behind the 
shoreline from rising water tables and reduced  drainage. More than half of Oahu’s 9,400 acres  in the SLR -
XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise are  Urban designated lands. Some examples of areas that will be exposed Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
154 to chronic flooding include Campbell Industrial Park, Pearl Harbor, Kahuku, and Waimānalo,  as shown in 
Figure 96. Portions of Campbell Industrial Park and Pearl Harbor, two of the largest job centers in Hawaiʻi,  
would be permanently flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. New and expanded wetland areas would form 
around Kahuku potentially improving wildlife habitat. As Waimānalo Beach erodes and retreats with rising 
seas, properties along the shoreline would become increasingly vulnerable to flooding and erosion. If we 
continue to follow past practices of allowing shor eline armoring, portions of Waimānalo Beach will erode 
away. In the Māpunapuna area, existing communities and businesses are already experiencing recurring 
flooding during the highest tides because of rising seas. Difficult decisions will have to be made t o either 
abandon such areas or invest in expensive multi -decadal mitigation projects to dewater or raise the ground 
above the rising water.  
Over time, as sea level continues to rise, low -lying, populated coastal communities such as Waialua would 
experience  increased frequency and severity of flooding ultimately leading to permanent inundation and 
making some areas of the coast impassable or uninhabitable ( Figure 97). Decisions about where to use 
coastal armoring and when to retreat  will need to be made carefully. It should be noted that seawalls may 
not be effective at preventing flooding with sea level rise in many low -lying areas as rising groundwater can 
infiltrate through porous geology.  While specific responses to sea level ris e would need to be place -based, 
larger regional issues should also be considered, such as whether to armor in place or whether to relocate 
roads and other critical infrastructure inland. A good example of this is where Kamehameha Highway 
passes through an area known as Laniākea on the North Shore. The road is overtopped by waves in the 
winter months and the beach in front of the highway has nearly vanished. The Department of Transportation 
(DOT) Highways Division is considering options including armoring an d raising the road or relocating the 
road inland.  
In the case of Waialua, opportunities for managed retreat inland exist, as there are ample vacant lands 
immediately  mauka  (landward) and outside of the SLR -XA. However, as discussed in the 
Recommendations c hapter of this Report, and as with other populated coastal areas with adjacent vacant 
lands, large -scale boundary amendments should be predicated on appropriate state policies and guidelines 
(e.g., within Chapter 205, State Land Use Act) to provide the sup portive legal basis for major land use 
changes.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

158 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
Oahu’s total land area, 3 86,188 acres, is 85% smaller than the land area of the Island of  Hawaiʻi, the biggest 
island in the archipelago. Currently, almost one third of Oahu’s land area is located in the State Land Use 
Urban District (State of Hawai'i 2015). Over the last 50 years , an estimated 26,000 acres of agricultural 
land, almost 7% of the total land area, has been converted to urban land to address the growing demand 
for housing. As sea level rises, and more land area becomes chronically flooded, there will be increasing 
pressure to convert Agricultural and Conservation District lands to Urban District land.  
Sea level rise would result in impacts within the State Urban, Agricultural, and Conservation Land Use 
Districts around the island . However, Urban District lands woul d experience the greatest extent of chronic 
flooding  (Figure 98) as almost 60% of the 9,400 acres located within the SLR -XA are designated for Urban 
use. Due to the density and extent of vulnerable lands within the SLR -XA, leaders sh ould not rule out the 
potential benefits of a managed retreat approach for communities or business districts already affected by 
sea level rise.  
While the State Land Use Law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 205) could be used to address  major 
land use changes as part of a managed retreat strategy, County General Plan and Community Plan updates 
provide important opportunities to address land use issues with rising seas at the local level. Revised and 
updated SMA policies, objectives, and requirements offer additional opportunities at the local level to 
prepare for sea level rise. Moreover, if the City & County of Honolulu chooses to recognize the SLR -XA 
with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone (one of the recommendations in Ch apter 5), it migh t 
be prudent  to consider adjusting SMA boundaries to coincide with the SLR -XA so that new subdivisions, 
commercial areas, hotels, and other development activities could undergo a higher level of review in light 
of sea level rise constraints.  Figure 99 illustrates the partial overlap of SMA boundaries with the SLR -XA 
along portions of Pōkaʻi Bay.  
Additional controls on development along the coast may be necessary to  protect Native Hawaiian trad itional 
and customary practices;  iwi kūpuna (ancestral bones) ; archaeological, heritage, and cultural resources; to 
ensure public access; and to mitigate the impacts of coastal hazards.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone in the County 
General Plan and Community Plan updates . 
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vuln erable urban areas with preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR -XA, wherever possible, under a 
long-term comprehensive adaptation strategy.

160 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOPLE AND PROPERTY  
People living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced when homes, condominiums, and 
businesses become flooded due to sea level rise . The potential number of people displaced is calculated 
by assigning an estimated occupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. Potential economic loss  in 
the SLR -XA is estimated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss estimates are assessed 
at the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids. The potential economic loss associated with flooded 
roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastructure is not accounted for in the assessment of 
economic impacts and would  add significant increases in losses.  
The potential number of displaced people island -wide could rise from 2,000 residents with 1.1 feet of sea 
level rise, to over 13,000 residents with 3.2 feet of sea level rise ( Figure 100). The people displaced would 
include a range of income levels and living arrangements. In addition, approximately 46% of the occupied 
housing units on O‘ahu are occupied by renters (U.S. Ce nsus Bureau 2015b) , so both homeowners and 
renters would be affected.  
Potential economic losses (all structures and land) island -wide would increase from an estimated $4.1 
billion with 1.1 feet of sea level rise, to $12.9 billion with 3.2 feet of sea lev el rise ( Figure 100). Approximately 
72% of the potential economic loss with 3.2 feet of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of residential 
structures and land. The potential economic loss across all sectors is associated with  approximately 3,800 
structures  and approximately 9,400 acres  of land in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. A number of 
the potentially flooded structures are hotels located in in Waik īkī, which is considered an important visitor 
destination area on the south shore of O‘ahu ( Figure 101). Private and public entities in Waikīkī and parts 
of Honolulu should begin to factor in long -term preparedness for sea level rise adaptation including dealing 
with basement flooding, beach restoration at Waikīkī Beach, and even consideration of how best to prepare 
for higher sea levels in the future.  
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, potential economic loss would occur in low-lying coastal areas island -wide, 
with the greatest loss along the south shore due to the concentration of high -value residential and 
commercial land and structures ( Figure 102). Over time, as the sea level continues to rise, communities on 
the west side of the island, such as ʻEwa Beach ( Figure  103), would  also experience increasing potential 
economic loss.  
  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
161 RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Require mandatory disclosure for vulnerable properties and consider acquisition to protect 
valuable coastal resources.  
 Seek  opportunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise under a long -term, comprehensive strategy.  
 Develop design standards to increase flood resiliency for existing and new development within 
the SLR -XA that cann ot be relocated.  
 Develop a multi -pronged financing strategy at federal, state, county, private sector, and 
philanthropic levels to address costs of adaptation to sea level rise.

165 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
Sea level rise would  result in significant impacts to roads, airports , harbors, electrical and 
telecommunications infrastructure, water/wastewater facilities and conveyance systems , and other public 
service facilities (i.e. schools, fire stations, police stations, medical facilities) on O‘ ahu. Following the trends 
of private development, O ahu’s critical public infrastructure is concentrated along low -lying shores and is 
highly  vulnerable to flooding  and erosion in the SLR -XA. An estimated 5.5 miles of major  roads would  be 
flooded  in the SLR -XA with 1.1 feet of sea le vel rise, increasing to over 17 miles with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise ( Figure 100). Portions of many coastal roads, such as Kamehameha Highway  in the vicinity of the 
community of Ka‘a‘awa, would become chronically flooded and erod ed away (Figure 104). Kamehameha 
Highway, in the vicinity of Ka‘a‘awa , is already one of the most vulnerable coastal highways in Hawaiʻi . It is 
ironic that  Hawaiians referred to this area as He kai ‘a‘ai ko Ka‘a‘awa , a sea that we ars away the land . 
Wide -spread damage of coastal highways would result in the loss of commerce, loss of access to 
emergency services, and increased traffic on other roads and highways, some of which serve as the only 
access in and out of many communities. Electric and telecommunication transmission lines commonly 
follow roads and those located underground in the SLR -XA may be impacted by sea level rise resulting in 
service disruptions.  
The primary transportation arteries for the entry of people and goods to  the State, the Daniel K. Inouye 
International Airport and Honolulu Harbor, would become increasingly exposed to chronic flooding from sea 
level ri se (Figure 105). The Honolulu International Airport, the busiest ai rport in the state, serves more than 
19 million passengers a year and receives more than 228,000  tons of cargo (based on the amount of 
incoming cargo in 2014)  (State of Hawai'i 2015) . More than 14.6 million ton s of commodities pass through 
Honolulu Harbor annually (based on cargo that passed through the harbor in 2014) and more than 400,000 
cruise ship passengers sailed into or out of the harbor in 2015 (State of Hawa i'i 2015) . Interru ption of 
interisland and tr ansoceanic shipping and travel  would impact residents, visitors, and all forms of economic 
activity .  
While no wastewater treatment facilities on O‘ahu are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise, sea level rise may impact wastewater stabilization ponds immediately surrounding the Sand Island 
and Kahuku Wastewater Treatment Plants . Flooding of these ponds would have the potential of releasing 
wastewater into nearshore waters. There are also no hospitals located with the SLR -XA. However, the  
Hau‘ula fire station , the Wa ikīkī Police Substation,  and the Straub Hawai‘i Kai Family Health Center , along 
with nine schools,  are located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise .  
More detailed analyses of vulnerability and adaptation options for critical infrastructure are need ed to 
evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocation. State and County agencies should consider 
potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as early as possible 
(e.g., flood proofing and relocating in frastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost of maintaining and 
repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in p lace over the next 30 to 70 years. Please keep in 
mind that infrastructure losses have not been monetized. However, i t should  be noted that these costs Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
166 could  be an order of magnitude greater than the potential economic lo sses estimated from  land and 
structure s.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Conduct in -depth vulnerability assessments and evaluation of adaptation strategies for exist ing 
critical infrastructure throughout the County . 
 Consider long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures now (e.g., 
major flood proofing or relocation) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically 
threatened pu blic infrastructure over the next 30  to 70 years.  
 Require that the design and siting of new development and capital improvement projects include 
an in -depth analysis of sea level rise impacts based on elevation, tolerance for risk, and lifetime 
of the stru cture .

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provide for the economic self -sufficiency of Native Hawaiians 
through a homesteading p rogram (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Home Lands include areas from mauka  to makai  (from the mountain to the sea). Coastal portio ns 
of Hawaiian Home Lands, such as in Nānākuli ( Figure 106), would be flooded with sea level rise displacing 
Native Hawaiian families that live in this area. In addition, fishing and cultural practices taking place along 
the shore  would be impacted as beaches erode. In a recent study of multiple coastal hazards, three of the 
six Hawaiian Home Lands on O‘ahu —Nānākuli, Princess Kahanu Estates, and Waimānalo —are estimated 
to have the greatest potential for people to be displaced by ts unamis, waves, and sea level rise (University 
of Hawaiʻi 2015) . 
In addition to Native Hawaiian communities, m any Native Hawaiian cultural and historical resources are 
located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosion already  threatens areas 
that have served as burial grounds, home sites, fishponds, and other places  of cultural significance (Kane 
et al. 2012) . The number of cultural sites  on O‘ahu  in the SLR -XA is projected to increase from 105 sites 
with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise , to 189 with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Th is includes the  Pahipahi ‘ālua burial 
and a portion of  the Kawela Bay Subsurface Cultural Deposit , which may be flooded as a result of sea level 
rise ( Figure 107). Flooding caused by r ising seas would  also impact  loko i ‘a (ancient Hawaiian fishponds) 
such as  the He‘eia Fishpond.

POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  COASTAL RESOURCES AN D PUB LIC ACCESS  
Oahu ’s beaches play a critical role in recreation for our residents and Hawaii’s overall economy (Cristini et 
al. 2013) . Oahu’s beaches are estimated to provide recreati onal services valued at roughly $700 million per 
year, of which $32 million comes from Hanauma Bay (Penn et al. 2016) . Waikīkī  Beach is estimated t o be 
worth over $2 billion in annual visitor expenditures  (Hospitality Advisors LLC 2008) . 
Approximately 1,200 acres of public beaches and parks (inclusive of city, state and federal parks) on O‘ahu 
are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Many  of these parks, such as Mā‘ili Beach 
Park in Wai‘anae (Figure 108) are located on the seaward side of major roads, and demonstrate how lightly -
developed parkland can provide a buffer between eroding shorelines and development for many deca des. 
However, sea level rise will lead to extensive beach loss if widespread shoreline hardening is permitted and 
beach systems are not allowed to migrate landward. Most beaches on Oʻahu are backed by deposits of 
older beach and dune sand (Sherrod et al. 2007)  which are crucial sources of sediment along eroding 
coasts. In a natural state, a beach can be maintained as it migrates landward if there is sufficient sand 
available in the backshore to nourish the beach as it erodes. Shoreline hardening locks up this backshore 
sediment source leading to beach narrowing and loss on chronically eroding beaches.  
 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
171 A study of historical shoreline changes in Hawaiʻi by the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of 
Hawaiʻi (Fletcher et al. 2012)  found that 60% of Oʻahu  beaches are chronically eroding . Over the past 
century, shoreline hardening was the typical response when beachfront property was threatened by erosion 
or flooding. As a result, approximately 20 miles of O‘ahu beaches are backed by seawalls and other  
shoreline hardening structures. Over 5 miles of beach fronting those structures has already been completely 
eroded away with waves now breaking directly against the structures.  
Looking at the future, sea level rise presents a serious threat to Oʻahu beac h environments and public 
shoreline access. At present, 15 miles of beach remains with shoreline hardening on the backshore (20 
miles minus the 5 miles of beach already lost). These 15 miles of beaches have a very high  risk of being 
eroded away in coming d ecades under increasing rates of chronic erosion with sea level rise. With 1.1 feet 
of sea level rise, an additional 7 miles of unprotected beachfront development will be exposed to erosion 
and flooding (i.e., within the SLR -XA). These 7 miles include 5 mi les of homes and buildings and 2 miles of 
coastal highway. With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, 20 miles of unprotected beachfront development will be 
exposed to erosion and flooding. These 20 miles include 13 miles of homes and buildings and 7 miles of 
coasta l highway. B eaches  fronting these areas of exposed development  face a high risk of loss if 
widespread shoreline  hardening  is allowed  rather than allowing beaches to migrate landward with sea level 
rise. 
As described in the Methods section, this analysis co nsiders a scenario where widespread armoring is 
permitted and does not consider other adaptation scenarios such as managed retreat from impacted areas 
or beach nourishment, which would help to extend the life of beaches . This analysis also does not account  
for effects of accelerated erosion that typically occurs fronting and adjacent to coastal armoring, leading to 
more widespread impacts. More research is needed to improve the understanding and projections of 
localized vulnerability of beach and environmen ts to the combined impacts of encroaching beachfront 
development and erosion and flooding with sea level rise.  
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats vital to aquatic organisms and wildlife would 
become flooded with sea level rise, chang ing the nature of such habitat s and the organisms that rely on 
them . Estuarine habitats, where freshwater from rivers and streams and saltwater from the sea meet and 
mix, would become increasingly marine with rising seas. This dynamic would impact areas su ch as Nu‘upia 
Ponds , an estuarine wetland between  Kāne‘ohe and Kailua Bays ( Figure 109). Hawaiian anchialine pools , 
land-locked bodies of water of varying salinity that are adjacent to the ocean  (The Nature Conservancy 
2012) , are occupied by small endemic red shrimp ( Halocaridina  and others) called ʻōpaeʻu la and 
the  endangered shrimp, Procaris hawaiana  (Fish and Wildlife Service 2016) . These pools have  indirect, 
underground connections to the sea, and show tid al fluctuations in water level. Other species,  restricted to 
the surface waters of the pools,  include a few fish species, crust aceans and other invertebrates. Two 
endangered waterbirds (Hawaiian St ilt and Hawaiian Coot), and several species  of migratory waterfowl 
also use these pools  (The Nature Conservancy 2012) .  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
172 Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. Septic ta nks, cesspools and other OSDS, hazardous materials 
storage and disposal sites, and Superfund sites  (sites deemed by the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency] to be contaminated with hazardous waste) could become flooded and release wastewater or 
contaminants to nearshore waters.   
OSDS a re located along m any shoreline areas around O‘ahu, in both urban and rural areas such as along 
the North Shore’s iconic Sunset Beach ( Figure 110). There are approximately 1,330 OSDS within the SLR -
XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise island -wide. A recent study of OSDSs in Honolulu revealed the potential 
for direct and widespread seepage of untreated sewage directly into coastal groundwater from the 
inundation of OSDSs by groundwater with sea level ris e (Habel et al. 2017) . Further, this study indicated 
that 86% of the OSDSs in the study area were non -compliant with construction standards.  
On O‘ahu, there are three Superfund sites. Only one of the Superfund sites, the Pearl Harbor  Naval 
Complex, is w ithin the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. The site’s listing indicates it is in an active 
military facility whose associated activities have contaminated soil, sediment, and groundwater with metals, 
organic compounds, and petroleum hydrocarbons. Th e reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level 
Rise Viewer  to determine if any infrastructure of interest is located in the SLR -XA. 
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Amend the State Legacy Lands Act to set aside funding for preserving priority coastal lands and 
use of a variety of practices and tools to enable legacy beaches to persist.  
 Develop shoreline conservation and restoration priorities and guidelines to support adaptation to 
sea level rise.  
 Expand th e area of national, state, and county parks and wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian 
Islands to preserve wetlands and wildlife.  
 Protect nearshore water quality by identifying hazard mitigation measures to address coastal 
flooding of hazardous material/was te storage facilities and OSDSs vulnerable to sea level rise.

Challenges and Opportunities  
The impact of sea level rise on O‘ahu alone is greater than all of the other islands combined due to  the size 
of the populatio n, and the extensive urbanization  of vulnerable coastal areas.  Even more troubling is the 
fact that impacts from chronic flooding with sea level rise on O‘ahu can easily reverberate and translate into 
major economic and social impacts for the other islands.  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties located on or near Oahu’s shorelines will increasingly be flooded, 
eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Portions of coastal roads will also become flooded, eroded, and even 
impassible or irreparable jeopardizing access to and from many communities. Beaches, like the Seven Mile 
Miracle on the North Shore will increasingly be eroded and permanently lost if hard structures such as roads 
and seawalls impede their landward migration. The flooding impacts to hotels and transportation systems, 
along with the loss of beaches, would  impact the tourism economy and thus impact not only the people 
whose livelihoods depend on it, but the State’s economy which relies heavily on revenues from the tourism 
industry.  
This Results section highlights just a few of the very real challenges on O ‘ahu with a scenario of 3.2 feet of 
sea level rise by the mid - to latter -part of the century. However, remember that sea level rise will not stop 
at the middle or end of the century. As highlighted throughout this Report, higher sea level rise projections 
are considered “physically plausible ” by the end of the century based on the latest climate science (Sweet 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
175 et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . While this Report models sea level rise up to 3.2 feet, it 
should be noted that NOAA has m odeled passive flooding scenarios with up to 6 feet of sea level rise in 
their Sea Level Rise Viewer (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from higher sea level scenarios, 
the 5 -foot passive flood layer from NOAA was incorporated into vulnerability assessment which increases 
the area of the SLR -XA on O‘ahu by 36%. Figure 111 shows how 5 feet of passive flooding with sea level 
rise would impact communities along Maunalua Bay. While there is uncertainty over when the islands might 
experience such extreme sea level rise, the information is provided mere ly to remind readers that sea level 
rise is going to continue for the remainder of the century and beyond.  
 
Figure 111. Potential additional area of chronic flooding with 5 feet of sea level rise  along Maunalua Bay,  
O‘ahu  
O‘ahu  has opportunities to plan for sea level rise now by considering the recommendations for adaptation 
presented in Chapter 5 of this Report.  Another threat that we will have to face with climate change is 
increased coastal flooding from  tropical storms, hurric anes, and tsunamis . The added risk fr om event -based 
coastal flooding exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report. However, these events pose a 
potential for loss of human life and property , and for severe and long -term economic disruption.  
Communities should consider planning new development to reduce exposure from severe events by 
recognizing that the coastal floodplain will migrate landward with increased sea level s. Hazard mitigation 
and disaster recovery projects should be reviewed and revised to address chronic and event -based flooding 
and consider the additive effects of accelerating sea level rise.

SEA LEVEL RISE STORI ES 
City & County of Honolulu  
CONSIDERING SEA LEVE L RISE IN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNIT IES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS  
“As a co mmunity, Honolulu has prepared for the risk of coastal flooding in a number of ways, but there is 
always room for improvement, especially with the changes likely due to climate change,” said  Mayor Kirk 
Caldwell. The City & County of Honolulu Administration  believes that climate change is real and must be 
reflected in its plans, regulations, rules and standards. What is needed now, explained Art Challacombe, 
former Deputy Director of the City & County Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting  (DPP) , is 
translating those priorities into regulatory action to ensure that Oahu’s coastal environments, development 
and communities are protected from sea level rise.  
To reflect these adaptation priorities, the DPP began incorporating “no regrets” climate change a daptation 
policies and guidelines in its development plans and sustainable community’s plans. These are the  long-
range regional land use and infrastructure plans guiding public and private development for O‘ahu, including 
those for North Shore, Wai‘anae an d ‘Ewa.  
To implement the sea level rise policies and guidelines in these plans, which call for analysis of the possible 
impact of sea level rise on all new public and private shoreline area projects, DPP began asking in 2015 that 
environmental assessments  and other applications for shoreline projects submitted to the Department for 
review and comment include such an analysis.

Kaua ‘i 
The Island of  Kaua‘i, the oldest and northernmost of the main Hawaiian islands, earns its reputation as the 
“Garden Isle” as 55% of the island’s land area is designated as being within the State Land Use 
Conservation Dis trict and includes 24 state -managed reserves, preserves, and park areas (County of Kaua'i 
Planning Department 2017) . Kaua‘i is the State’s fourth largest island with 353,504 acres, but only accounts 
for 5% of the State’s population with 71,735  residents (State o f Hawai'i 2015) . Although the population is 
relatively small, it has more than doubled over the last 50 years . This growth  coupled with a growing tourism 
industry —over 1.18 million visitors came to Kaua‘i  in 201 6 (State of Hawai'i 2016) —has placed ever 
increasing demands on natural resources  and basic services. Kaua ‘i currently faces many challenges 
including ageing infrastructure, planning for future growth, and lack of affordable housing . The impacts of 
sea level rise on the communities of Kaua‘i have the potential to exacerbate these existing challenges.  
Key Take Aways  
 Over the next 30 to 70 years, homes and businesses located near the shoreline will be impacted by 
sea level rise . Over 900 structures would  be chronically flooded by 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  
Kapa‘a , Kaua‘i

178  Of the 5,7 60 acres of land located within the SLR -XA, ap proximately 17% is designated for urban 
land uses.  
 With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, approximately 6.5  miles of Kauai’s coastal roads would become 
impassible jeopardizing access to and from many communities . 
 Kauaʻi has lost almost 4 miles of beaches to erosion fronting seawalls and other shoreline armoring. 
Many more miles of beach could be lost with sea level rise, if widespread armoring is allowed. 
Chapter 5 (Recommendations) explores opportunities to reduce  beach loss by improving beach 
protection policies.  
 A more detailed economic loss analysis  is needed of Kauai’s  critical infrastructure, including harbor  
facilities, a irport facilities,  sewage treatment plants, and roads. State and County agencies should 
consider potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as 
early as possible (e.g., relocating infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost of 
maintaining and repairing chronically threatened public infrastruc ture in place over the next 30 to 70 
years.  
This section provides a picture of the future of the Island of  Kaua ‘i with sea level rise  and the potential 
impacts if no action is taken. The results are based on modeling coastal flooding with sea level rise du e to 
passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion in the SLR -XA with up to 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise, and depicts flood hazards that may occur in the mid - to latter -half of this century. This timeframe 
is within the expected lifespan o f most new construction and much of our existing development. It should 
be noted that sea level rise projections greater than 3.2 feet are “physically plausible” by the end of the 
century, based on the latest climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bar s, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . 
Vulnerability to 1.1 feet of sea level rise in the SLR -XA is used to approximate current or near -term exposure 
to coastal hazards and sea level rise. Vulnerability is assessed in terms of potential impacts to land use, 
people, property, cultural and natural resources, and critical infrastructure (only land and structures are 
monetized, not infrastructure).  
The reade r is urged to exercise caution in interpreting the results, which could be to a greater or less er 
extent  depending on actual observed future sea level rise, technological innovations in climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, unknown economic variables, as well as future societal choice s which cannot be 
known today. Further, as not all parts of the island can be shown in detail, the reader should also visit the 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to explore the full extent of the vulnerability maps for each island.  
Potential Impacts in the Sea Level Rise Exposure Area  
The SLR -XA depicts the area of potential chronic flooding from exposure to passive flooding with sea  level 
rise. For the purposes of exposure and planning, we focus mainly on a scenario with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise. 
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, low -lying coastal areas around the island within the SLR -XA may become 
chronically flooded within the mi d- to latter -half of this century ( Figure 112). This land will become 
submerged by coastal erosion, direct marine flooding from tides and waves, or become new wetlands Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
179 behind the shoreline from rising water tables and reduced drai nage. Approximately 5,760 acres of land on 
Kaua‘i is estimated to be located in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. Some examples of areas that 
would be exposed to chronic flooding include Kēʻē Beach,  Kīlauea , Polihale Beach , and Nāwiliwili Harbor 
as illustrated  on Figure 113. The Town of Kīlauea  is one of the areas identified in the Kaua‘ i County General 
Plan that may be able to accommodate future growth. However, c hronic flooding associated with 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise in Kīlauea ’s low -lying beach areas would impact how and where this growth could occur. 
Many communities and businesses are already experiencing tidal flooding. Locations like Kē‘ē and Polihale 
provide the best opportunity for conserving na tural beach environments if backshore lands remain 
undeveloped and the beach is allowed to migrate landward with sea level rise. Portions of Nāwiliwili Harbor, 
the primary commercial harbor for Kaua‘i , would be flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. This may 
significantly impact residents and visitors to the island as essential commodities are dependent on ocean 
trans port (County of Kaua'i Planning Department 2017) .  
Over time, as sea level continues to rise, low -lying, populated coastal communities , such as Kekaha , would 
experience increased frequency an d extent of flooding potentially making some sections of the coastal 
highway impassible and some beachfront lots uninhabitable ( Figure 114). Decisions about where to use 
coastal armoring and when to retreat will ne ed to be made carefully. It should be noted that seawalls may 
not be effective at preventing flooding with sea level rise in many low -lying areas as rising groundwater can 
infiltrate through porous geology.  
While specific responses to sea level rise would need to be place -based, larger regional issues should also 
be considered, such as whether to armor in place or whether to relocate roads and other critical 
infrastructure inland . In the case of Kekaha , where there may be opportunities to consider a managed  
retreat strategy as there are ample vacant lands immediately mauka  (landward) and outside of the SLR -
XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, as discussed in Chapter 5 (Recommendations), large -scale 
boundary amendments should be predicated on appropri ate state policies and guidelines (e.g., within 
Chapter 205, State Land Use Act) to provide the supportive legal basis for major land use changes.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

183 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  LAND USE  
While sea level rise would result in impacts within the State A gricultural,  Urban, Rural, and Conservation 
Land Use Districts around the island, A gricultural  lands  would experience the greatest extent of chronic 
flooding with over half of the 5,7 60 acres of land located within the SLR -XA designated for agricultural use 
(Figure 115). This is in stark contrast to that of O‘ahu which has over 50 % of lands within the SLR -XA 
designated for urban use. Only 17% of the lands on Kaua‘i  within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise 
are located in the urban district. However, considering that currently only 4% of island’s total land area of 
353,900 a cres is within the Urban Land Use District  (State of Hawai'i 2015) , sea level rise would likely 
increase demands to convert existing agriculture and conservation lands to urban areas to respond to the 
likely shift in coastal infrastructure and population a way from the shoreline.  
While the State Land Use Law (Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Chapter 205) could be used to sort out major land 
changes as part of a managed retreat strategy, County General Plan and Community Plan updates provide 
important opportunities to address land use issues with rising seas at the local level. Revised and updated 
SMA policies, objectives, and requirements offer additional opportunities at the local level to prepare for 
sea level rise. Moreover, if the County of Kaua‘i  chooses to rec ognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise as a vulnerability zone (one of the recommendations in Ch apter 5), it might be prudent  to consider 
adjusting SMA boundaries to coincide with the SLR -XA so that new subdivisions, commercial areas, hotels, 
and other development activities could undergo a higher level of review in light of sea level rise constraints. 
Figure 116 illustrates the partial overlap of SMA boundaries with the SLR -XA along portions of Hanamaulu 
Bay. Additional  controls on development along the coast may be necessary to  protect Native Hawaiian 
traditional and customary practices,  iwi kūpuna (ancestral bones)  and other  archaeological, historical, and 
cultural resources, and to ensure public access and mitigate th e impacts of coastal hazards.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone in the County 
General Plan and Community Plan updates . 
 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vulnerable urban a reas with preservation of 
agriculture and conservation lands . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development outside of the SLR -XA, wherever possible, under a 
long-term comprehensive adaptation strategy . 
 Develop design standards to increase flood resiliency wi thin the SLR -XA.

185 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  PEOPLE AND PROPERTY  
People living and working within the SLR -XA would be displaced when homes, condominiums, and 
business become flooded due to sea level rise. The potential number of people displaced is calculated by 
assigning an estimated occupancy for each type of structure in the SLR -XA. Potential economic loss  in the 
SLR-XA is estimated based on the value of land and structures flooded. Loss estimates are assessed at 
the parcel level and aggregated into 1 -hectare grids. The potential economic loss associated with flooded 
roads, water/wastewater facilities, and other critical infrastructur e is not accounted for in the assessment 
and would add significant increases in losses.  
The potential number of displaced people  island -wide could rise from 990 residents with 1.1 feet  of sea 
level rise , to over 3,370 residents with 3.2 feet of sea level rise (Figure 117). The people displaced would 
include a range of income levels and living arrangements. In addition, approximately 38% of the occupied 
housing units on Kaua‘i are occupied by renters  (U.S. Census Bureau 2015c) , so both homeowners and 
renters would be affected  island -wide.  
Potential economic loss es (all structures and land) island -wide would  increase from an estimated $763 
million with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise , to more than $2.59 billion with 3.2 feet of sea level rise ( Figure 117). 
Approximately 84 % of the potential economic loss with 3.2 feet of sea level rise is attributed to the loss of 
residential structures and land . This potential economic loss is associated with approximately 930 structures  
and approximately 5,760 acres of land  in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level  rise. 
With 3.2 feet of sea level rise, potential economic loss would occur in low -lying coastal ar eas island -wide, 
with the greatest loss in urban areas along the coastline  including Kapa‘a , Waimea, Hā‘ena, and Hanalei 
(Figure 118). Over time, as the sea level continues to rise, communities such as Waimea  (Figure 119), 
would experience increasing potential economic loss.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Require mandatory disclosure for vulnerable properties and consider acquisition to protect 
valuable coastal resources . 
 Develop design standards to increase fl ood resiliency for existing and new development within 
the SLR -XA that cannot be relocated . 
 Seek opportunities to plan new development well landward of the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea 
level rise under a long -term, comprehensive strategy . 
 Develop a multi -pronged financing strategy at federal, state, county, private sector, and 
philanthropic levels to address costs of adaptation to sea level rise .

189 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCT URE  
Sea level rise would result in significant impacts to roads, airports, harbors,  electrical and 
telecommunication infrastructure,  water/wastewater facilities a nd conveyance systems , and other public 
service facilities (i.e.  schools, fire stations, police stations, medical facilities) on Kaua‘i. Following the trends 
of private development, portions of Kaua ‘i’s critical public infrastructure is concentrated along low-lying 
shores and is vulnerable to flooding  and erosion in the SLR -XA. An estimated 2.3 miles of major  roads  
island -wide would be flooded in the SLR -XA with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise, increasing to 6.5 miles with 3.2 
feet of sea level rise  (Figure 117). Portions of many coastal roads, such as  Kūhīo Highway,  would become 
chronically flooded and eroded away (Figure 120). This could result in wide -spread regional issues such as 
loss of commerce and increased traffic on other roads and highways, some of which serve as the o nly 
access in and out of many communities. Electric and telecommunication transmission lines commonly 
follow roads and those located underground in the SLR -XA may be impacted by sea level rise resulting in 
service disruptions.  
One of the primary transporta tion arteries for the entry of people and goods to the island is Līhu‘e Airport. 
However, due to the rocky coastline around the airport, minimal chronic flooding with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise is projected. In contrast, Port Allen Airport, a smaller airpo rt servicing the Hanapepe area, would have 
a greater exposure as over 60 acres of its runway and facilities would be exposed to chronic flooding in the 
SLR-XA. Further, Nāwiliwili Harbor, another primary transportation artery, would also become increasingl y 
exposed to chroni c flooding from sea level rise ( Figure 121). This could result in interruption to interisland 
and transoceanic shipping and travel, impacting residents, visitors, and overall economic activity. In 
addition, two schools are expected to be flooded with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. No fire stations, police 
stations, hospitals or wastewater treatment plants are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise. 
More detailed analyses of vulnerability and adapt ation options for critical infrastructure would be needed to 
evaluate adaptation options such as retrofitting or relocation . State and County agencies should consider 
potential long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures as ea rly as possible 
(e.g., flood proofing and relocating infrastructure sooner than later) compared to the cost of maintaining and 
repairing chronically threatened public infrastructure in p lace over the next 30 to 70 years.  Please keep in 
mind that infrastruc ture losses have not been monetized. However, i t should be noted that these costs 
could  be an order of magnitude greater than the potential economic lo sses estimated from  land and 
structure s.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

RECOMMENDATION H IGHLIGHTS  
 Conduct in -depth vulnerability assessments and evaluation of adaptation strategies for existing 
critical infras tructure throughout the County.  
 Consider long -term cost savings from implementing sea level rise adaption measures now (e.g., 
major flo od proofing or relocation) compared to the cost of maintaining and repairing chronically 
threatened public infrastru cture over the next 30 to 70 years.  
 Require the design and siting of new development and capital improvement projects to include 
an in -depth  analysis of sea level rise impacts based on elevation, tolerance for risk , and lifetime 
of the structure.

192 POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO  NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMM UNITIES AND CULTURAL  RESOURCES  
Hawaiian Home Lands are intended to provide for the economic self -suffici ency of Native Hawaiians 
through a homesteading program (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Consistent with Native Hawaiian culture, 
Hawaiian Home Lands include areas from mauka  to makai  (from the mountain to the sea). Coastal portio ns 
of Hawaiian Home Lands, such as in Anahol a (Figure 122), would b e flooded with sea level rise displacing 
Native Hawaiian families that live in this area. In addition, fishing and cultural practices taking place along 
the shore would be impacted as beaches erode. In a recent study of multiple coastal hazards, three of the 
eight  Hawaiian Home Lands  homesteads  on Kaua‘i —Anahola , Kekaha , and Kapa‘a —are estimated to have 
the greatest potential for people to be displac ed by tsunamis, waves, and sea level rise (University of 
Hawaiʻi 2015) . 
In addition to Native Hawaiian communities, m any Native Hawaiian cultural and historical resources  are 
located near the shoreline  and are threatened by sea level rise . Coastal erosion already  threatens areas 
that have served as burial grounds, home sites, fish ponds, and other places  of cultural significance (Kane 
et al. 2012) . The number of cultural sites in the SLR -XA on Kauaʻi is projected to increase from 55 sites 
with 1.1 feet  of sea level rise , to 80 with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. This includes t he Palik ū Beach  burial  
which may be flooded as a result of sea level rise ( Figure 123). Additionally, the traditional practice of hana  
pa‘akai ( salt making) is at risk due to sea level rise. The salt ponds in Hanap ēpē (Figure 124), which have 
been maintained and harvested for many generations, have experienced impacts from increasing flooding 
in recent years due to the higher high tides and changes in weather. Normally, underground sea water 
seeps up through the bottom of  a main well known as the puna a nd that water is then transferred to a 
secondary well called a wai ku. Once salt crystals begin to form, the brine is transferred to a clay drying 
bed or lo‘i where the salt crystals will start appearing. The recent flooding  has interrupted the drying of the 
salt so farmers have implemented adaptation strategies such as raising the level of the loi’s and fortifying 
the walls of the wai ku (Hiraishi 2017) .  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Develop an inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices impacted by sea level 
rise. 
 Work with Native Hawaiian communities to determine steps they want to take regarding climate 
impacts . 
 Develop adaption plans to preserve access to coastal land and water within Native Hawaiian 
communities .

POT ENTIAL IMPACTS TO CO ASTAL RESOURCES AND PUBLIC ACCESS  
Kaua ‘i has approximately 55 miles of sandy beaches, including the longest stretch of beach in the State, 
Polihale Beach, located on the west side of the island (O'Connell 2010) . These  beaches play a critical role 
in recreation for Kauai’s  residents and economy. According to the County of Kauai’s General Plan (County 
of Kaua'i Planning Department 2017)  employment in tourism -related industries accounts for 30% of all 
employment on the island.  
Approximately 372 acres of public beaches and parks (inclusive of c ounty , state and federal parks) on 
Kaua ‘i are located within the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise.  Many of these parks, such as Kekaha 
Beach Park  (Figure 125), are located on the seaward side of major roads, and demonstrate how lightly -
developed parkland can provide a buffer between eroding shorelines and development for many decades. 
Sea lev el rise will lead to extensive beach loss if widesp read shoreline hardening is permitted and beach 
systems are not allowed to migrate landward. Most beaches on Kauaʻi are backed by deposits of older 
beach and dune sand (Sherrod et al. 2007)  which are crucial sources  of sediment along eroding coasts. In 
a natural state, a beach can be maintained as it migrates landward if there is sufficient sand available in 
the backshore to nourish the beach as it erodes. Shoreline hardening locks up this backshore sediment 
source l eading to narrowing and loss of chronically eroding beaches.  
 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
195  
Figure 125. Potential chronic flooding of Kekaha Beach Park in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise in 
the Waimea -Kekaha District, Kaua‘i  
 
A study of historical shoreline changes in Hawaiʻi by the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of 
Hawaiʻi (Fletcher et al. 2012)  found that 70% of Kauaʻi beaches are chronically eroding. Over the past 
century, shoreline hardening was the typical response throughout Hawaiʻi when beachfront property was 
threatened by erosion or flooding. As a result, approximately 5 miles of Kauai’s beaches are backed by 
seawalls and other shoreline hardening structures. Nearly 4 miles of beaches fronting those structures has 
already been completely eroded away.  
Looking at the future, sea level rise presents a serious threat to Kauaʻi beach environmen ts and public 
shoreline access. At present, 1 mile of beach remains with shoreline hardening on the backshore (5 miles 
minus the 4 already lost). This 1 mile of beach has a very high risk of being eroded away in coming decades 
under increasing rates of chr onic erosion with sea level rise. With 1.1 feet of sea level rise, an additional 5 
miles of unprotected beachfront development will be exposed to erosion and flooding (i.e. within the SLR -
XA). These 5 miles include 3 miles of homes and buildings and 2 mile s of coastal highways. With 3.2 feet 
of sea level rise, 12 miles of unprotected beachfront development will be exposed to erosion and flooding. 
The 12 miles include 8 miles of homes and buildings and 4 miles of coastal highways. Beaches fronting 
these area s of exposed development face a high risk of loss if widespread shoreline hardening is allowed 
rather than allowing beaches to migrate landward with sea level rise.  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
196 As described in the Methods section, this analysis considers a scenario where widespread ar moring is 
permitted and does not consider other adaptation scenarios such as managed retreat from impacted areas 
or beach nourishment, which would help extend the life of beaches such as Poʻipū and Kapaʻa. This analysis 
also does not account for effects of  accelerated erosion that typically occurs fronting and adjacent to coastal 
armoring, leading to more widespread impacts. More research is needed to improve the understanding and 
projections of localized vulnerability of beach and environments to the combi ned impacts of encroaching 
beachfront development and erosion and flooding with sea level rise.  
 
Besides recreational areas, a variety of coastal habitats, vital to aquatic organisms and wildlife would 
become flooded with sea level rise changing the natur e of such  habitat s and the organisms that rely on 
them . Estuarine habitat, where freshwater from rivers and streams and saltwater from the sea meet and 
mix, such as those feeding into Hanalei Bay, would become increasing marine with rising seas. Existing 
wetlands, such as those located near the Pacific Missile Range Facility, could be altered through chronic 
flood conditions from marine inundation and changes in groundwater tables ( Figure 126). In addition, new 
wetlands could be cr eated.  Kauai’s Erosion -based Shoreline Building Setbacks with Rising Seas  
In 2014, Kaua‘i adopted an updated erosion -rate-based shoreline building setback ordinance (State of Hawai'i 
Council of the County of Kaua'i 2014)  based on study of historical coastal erosion rates conducted for the 
County by the University of Hawai‘i Coastal Geology Group. The ordinance categoriz es two different 
lot/property types for shoreline setbacks; (1) lots that were included in the erosion study (generally, lots fronting 
beaches) and  (2) lots not included in the erosion study. For lots included in the erosion study, the distance of 
the shor eline setback line is measured from the certified shoreline as shown in the table below.  
Average Lot Depth  Setback Line  
Less than 140 feet  40 feet plus (70 X annual coastal erosion rate) plus 20 feet  
140 feet to 220 feet  Greater of: 40 feet plus (70 X a nnual coastal erosion rate) plus 20 feet -or- 
(Average Lot Depth minus 100 feet) ÷ by 2 plus 40 feet  
Greater than 220 feet  Greater of: 40 feet plus (70 X annual coastal erosion rate) plus 20 feet -or- 
100 feet from the certified shoreline  
For lots not in cluded in the erosion study (e.g., rocky coasts), the setback is calculated by the following formula, 
(Average Lot Depth -100)/2+40), subjec t to the following:  
 For lots with natural occurring rocky shorelines, the shoreline setback line shall be no less tha n 40 feet.  
 For all other lots, the shoreline setback line shall be no less than 60 feet.  
 For all lots, the maximum setback that can be required shall be 100 feet.  
This ordinance is one of the most aggressive of its kind in the State and one of the most progressive in the 
nation. While this ordinance will go a long way in the short -term to protect beaches and new development 
threatened by sea level rise, like the other islands, Kauaʻi faces the challenge of addressing potential erosion 
and flooding impact s to older, existing beachfront development sited without sufficient setbacks.  In addition, 
erosion rates will accelerate with sea level rise. As depicted in this Report as the SLR -XA, chronic flooding due 
to sea level rise is a composite of passive floodi ng, annual high wave flooding, and coastal erosion.  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
197 Sea level rise also has the potential to impact facilities that release wastewater or hazardous materials to 
nearshore waters  and coastal habitats. Septic ta nks, cesspools and other OSDS s, as well as hazardous 
materials storage  and disposal sites, could become flooded and release wastewater or contaminants to 
nearshore waters. OSDS are located along populated  areas of Kauai’s shoreline, such as along H ā‘ena on 
the North Shore ( Figure 127). Island -wide t here are approximately  456 OSDS within the SLR -XA with 3.2 
feet of sea le vel rise. The reader should visit the online Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Viewer  to determine if 
infrastructure of interest is located in the SLR -XA. 
RECOMME NDATION HIGHLIGHTS  
 Amend the State Legacy Lands Act to set aside funding for preserving priority coastal lands and 
use of a variety of practices and tools to enable legacy beaches to persist.  
 Develop shoreline conservation and restoration priorities and gu idelines to support adaptation to 
sea level rise.  
 Expand the area of national, state, and county parks and wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian 
Islands to preserve wetlands and wildlife.  
 Protect nearshore water quality by identifying hazard mitigation mea sures to address coastal 
flooding of hazardous material/waste storage facilities and OSDSs vulnerable to sea level rise.

Challenges and Opportunities  
Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties located on or near Kauai’s shorelines will increasingly be flooded, 
eroded or completely lost to the sea. Portions of coastal roads will also become flooded, erode d, impassible , 
and irreparable jeopardizing access to and from many communities. Beaches will increasingly be eroded 
and permanently lost if hard structures such as roads and seawalls impede their landward migration. The 
flooding of hotels and transportati on systems, along with the loss of beaches, would impact not only the 
people whose livelihoods depend on it, but the State’s economy which relies heavily on revenues from the 
tourism industry. This Results section highlights just a few of the very real cha llenges on Kaua‘i with a 
scenario of 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the mid - to the latter -part of the century.  
Sea level rise will not stop at the middle or end of the century. As highlighted throughout this Report, higher 
sea level rise projections are c onsidered “physically plausible ” by the end of the century based on the latest 
climate science (Sweet et al. 2017, Le Bars, Drijfhout, and de Vries 2017) . While this Report models sea 
level rise up to 3.2 feet, it should be noted that NOAA has model ed passive flooding  scenarios with up to  6 
feet of sea level rise  in their Sea Level Rise Viewer  (NOAA 2017b) . To illustrate potential impacts from 
higher sea level scenarios,  the 5-foot passive  flood layer  from NOAA was incorporated into our vulnerability 
assessment which increases the area of the SLR -XA on Kaua’i by 29%. Figure 128 shows the potential 
extent of 5 feet of passive flooding with sea level rise in the community of Wailua.  While there is uncertainty 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
199 over when the islands might experience such extreme sea level rise, the informati on is provided merely to 
remind readers that sea level rise is going to continue for the remainder of the century and beyond.  
 
Figure 128. Potential additional area of chronic flooding with 5 feet of sea level rise in Wailua, Kau a‘i 
Kaua‘i has opportunities to plan for sea level rise now by considering County General Plan and Community 
Plan updates that recognize the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea l evel rise as a vulnerability zone  and to plan 
for future land use now. In addition to chronic coastal flooding from sea level rise, tropical storms, 
hurricanes, and tsunamis create waves that flood low -lying coastal areas. The added risk from event -based 
coastal flooding  exacerbated by sea level rise is not included in this Report.  However,  these events pose a 
potential for loss of human life and property, and for severe and long -term economic disruption. 
Communities should consider planning new development to reduce exposure from severe events by 
recognizing that the coastal floodplain will  migrate landward with increased sea level. Hazard mitigation 
and disaster recovery projects should be reviewed and revised to address chronic and event -based flooding 
and consider the additive effects of accelerating sea level rise.

being considered for the first time in the county’s long -range planning. To  do this, the County approached 
the University of Hawai‘i Sea Grant College Program to prepare a technical study on climate change and 
coastal hazard impacts to inform the General Plan which hadn’t been updated since 2000.  
The study, the Kaua‘i Climate Cha nge and Coastal Hazards Assessment, is groundbreaking in that it marks 
the first time that climate change impacts will be considered in the long -range planning of the Kaua‘i General 
Plan. Kaua‘i County has been active in some sea level rise adaptation meas ures to date, but this effort will 
be the first time that language is included in the General Plan , informing actions across county departments 
for the next 30 years.  
The incorporation of climate change adaptation into long -range planning such as the Kaua‘ i County General 
Plan is critical for cohesive and sustained response to sea level rise. Kauaʻi Planning Director Michael 
Dahilig expressed the need to act to address sea level rise, “We’re trying to get ahead of the curve in 
anticipating that yes, given all  the science, given everything that is pointing in this direction, we may not see 
it immediately now but we anticipate it and that’s just good planning in general.”

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
201 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands  
The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) are comprised of small islands, atolls, and shoals located to 
the northwest of the islands of Kaua‘i and Ni‘ihau ( Figure 129). These islands a re part of the State of Hawaiʻi, 
with the exception of  Midway Atoll  which is an unincorporated territory of the United States.  Spanning more 
than 1,200 nautical miles, all of the islands ar e uninhabited, little known, and rarely visited. Only a few 
wildlife managers, researchers, and cultural practitioners are allowed to visit on a temporary basis. While 
the total l and area of the NWHI is only 3.1 square miles  (the main Hawaiian Islands has a total land area 
of 5,362 square miles) the islands, atolls, shoals and waters of the NWHI are highly protected because of 
the area’s biological, cultural, and historical resources and significance. Because of this, the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands Marin e National Monument was established by Presidential Proclamation on June 15, 
2016, and a year later it was given its Hawaiian name, Papahānumokuākea. The name 
Papahānumokuākea commemorates the union of two Hawaiian ancestors —Papahānumoku and Wākea —
who gave  rise to the Hawaiian archipelago, the taro plant, and the Hawaiian people. The 
Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM) encompasses all the NWHI  (Figure 129) and 
includes the Midway Atoll National Wildlif e Refuge and the NWHI National Wildlife Refuge.  The PMNM is 
globally recognized as a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) site.

202 Key Take Aways  
 Flooding and loss of beaches utilized as hauling -out sites for resting and pupping, could threaten 
the endangered Hawa iian monk seal population.  
 Flooding and loss of Hawaiian green turtle nesting areas, especially the area of French Frigate 
Shoals where 90% of the species’ population nests, could cause dramatic migration or decline in 
population.  
 Flooding and loss of low -lying coastal lands, which serves as seabird nesting habitat for 25 
protected migratory birds, could cause migration or decline in populations.  
 Flooding due to sea level rise could cause significant land loss to the already small land area of 
the NWHI. Wit h 6.6 feet of sea level rise, some atolls could be submerged completely.  
The coral reef and low island ecosystems of the NWHI  are among the places most vulnerable to climate 
change (Wagner and Polhemus 2016) . Changes in ocean circulation, chemistry, and productiv ity may result 
in impacts to wildlife that inhabit both land and sea . In the context of sea level rise, it is very lik ely that within 
the next 50 to 100 years, NWHI’s  low-lying atolls will be submerged with some atolls being affect ed sooner 
and more extensively (Wagner and Polhemus 2016) . Beach and coastal strand habitats are very likely to 
be lost as a result of sea level rise, storm inundation, and erosion with significant implications for 
endangered species that rely on these habitats for nes ting and breeding, including monk seals, sea turtles, 
and seabirds. Inland waters, both freshwater habitats and the hypersaline lake on Laysan, are likely to be 
degraded by passive flooding, storm overwash, and changes in precipitation, compromisin g critic al habitats 
for a range of endemic and protected species.  
Potential Impacts of Sea Level Rise  
HAWAIIAN MONK SEALS  
Protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and Hawaiʻi 
state law, ‘Ilio-holo-i-ka-uaua or  Hawaiian  monk seal ( Neomonachus schauinslandi ) is one of the most 
endangered marine mammals in the world  (NOAA Fisheries 2017c) . Endemic to Hawai ‘i, the main 
population of Hawaiian monk seals reside in the NWHI. The best estimate of the current total Hawaiian 
monk seal population is 1,400 seals ; about 1,100 in the NWHI and about 300 in the main Hawaiian Islands  
(from Ni ‘ihau to Hawai ‘i). The overall population decline in the NWHI has been moderated by the increasing 
population of seals in the main Hawaiian Islands. The most recent annual population assessment shows 
that the Hawaiian monk seal, bucking past trends, has increased in numbers by 3% annually for the past 
three years. While numbers have increased since 2013  across the archipelago , the long -term decline in 
abundance at the six main NWHI sites (French Frigate Shoals, Laysan, Lisianski, Pearl and Hermes, 
Midway, and Kure) remains concerning.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
203  
In the NWHI, the monk seals area already dealing with the  loss of terrestrial habitat , especially at French 
Frigate Shoals, where pupping and resting islets have shrunk or disappeared (Reynolds et al. 2012, 
Antonelis et al. 2006) . The French Frigate Shoal s (Figure 130), loc ated in the center of the NWH I (Figure 
129), is the p rimary pupping and resting site for Ha waiian monk seals throughout the Hawaiian archipelago. 
The loss of atoll islets , such as French Frigate Shoals  will increase with sea level rise. However, efforts to 
mitigate this ongoing loss of habitat are already being taken.  Specifically, the rules und er the ESA regarding 
Hawaiian monk seal critical habitat  have been revised to expand the critical habitat designation to the  NWHI 
and include new areas in the  main Hawaiian Islands  to reflect new information about Hawaiian monk seal 
habitat use ( NOAA Fisheries (2017a) . Critical habitat s are geographic areas that contain features that are 
essential to the co nservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special 
management considerations or protections. The critical habitat  areas contain one or a combination of the 
features essential to Hawaiian monk seal conservation including preferred  pupping and nursing areas, 
significant haul -out areas, and marine foraging areas out to 200 m eters  in de pth (Figure 131).

Endangered Hawaiian monk seals are likely to be adversely affected by sea level rise  as their breeding 
sites and haul -out sites are inundated and eroded and the abundance of their prey is reduced  (Wagner and 
Polhemus 2016) . In order to mitigate the effects of sea level rise, we should being planning for the landward 
migration of the terrestrial portion of the monk seal critical habitat in the main Hawaiia n Islands so that we 
can ensure the survival of the species with rising seas.

206 HAWAIIAN GREEN TURTL E 
The threatened honu  or Hawaiian green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) is also pro tected under the ESA and 
Hawaiʻi State Law. While green turtles are found throughout tropical and subtropical areas of the world, the 
threatened Hawaiian green turtle is genetically distinct from the other green sea turtle populations  (NOAA 
Fisheries (2017b) . While this species was in a steep decline due to the  direct harvest ing of both  the turtles  
themselves  and their eggs by  humans in the NWHI and main Hawaiian Islands (Van Houtan et al. 2012, 
Kittinger et al. 2013, Van Houtan and Kittinger 2014) , the population has grown steadily over the last thirty 
years following ESA protection in  1978.  
Hawaiian  green turtles nest throughout the archipelago in at least five major nesting sites ; four of which are 
in the NWHI (Kittinger et al. 2013)  and t hey migrate to f eed mainly in the coastal areas of the main Hawaiian 
Islands. Today, more than 90% of the population of  the Hawaiian  green turtles nests solely on  East Island 
at French Frigate Shoals ( Figure 130) (Pilcher, Chal oupka, and Woods 2012) . This location is particularly 
vulnerable to sea level rise  due to low elevation of nesting sites. (Baker, Littnan, and Johnston 2006) . Sea 
level rise will flood and erode existing and potential new nesting beaches for Hawaiian green turtles. 
Therefore, it would be prudent that we begin planning for the migration of this species to beaches suitable 
for nesting on the main Hawaiian Islands .  
 
SEABIRDS  
The NWHI is the largest tropical seabird rookery in the world, hosting over 5.5 million breeding adult 
seabirds (Keller e t al. 2009) . It provides nesting habitat for 25 species that are protected under the Migratory 
Bird Treaty Act, including the short-tailed albatross, which is also listed under the ESA (Wagner and 
Polhemus 2016) . In addition, 95%  of the world’s Laysan and black-footed albatrosses nest in the NWHI, as 
do globally significant colonies of Bonin petrels and Tristam’s storm petrels. Some of the largest colonies 
of white terns and red-tailed tropicbirds in the Central Pacific are found in the NWHI,  and numerous 
Threatened Hawaiian green turtle at French Frigate Shoals (Source: NOAA)  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
207 shorebird species ove rwinter or transit through NWHI during their migrations to the north and south. 
Endemic birds found in the NWHI’s include remarkably isolated species such as the Nihoa finch, Nihoa 
millerbird, Laysan finch, and Laysan duck, one of the world’s rarest ducks . Of these four species, the Laysan 
finch is listed as vulnerable by International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN ) and the other three 
are listed as critically endangered.  
The majority (72%)  of the world's nesting population  of mōlī or Laysan albaltross ( Phoebastria immutabilis ), 
resides  on Midway Atoll ( Figure 132). Wisdom, the oldest known banded bird in the wild, is a female Laysan 
albatross that nests within the world's largest albat ross colony on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. 
She is at least 65 -years old and  is a world renowned symbol of hope for all species that depend upon the  
health of the ocean to survive. As with Hawaiian monk seals and green turtles, sea birds and othe r wildlife 
that depend on low -lying coastal areas throughout the Hawaiian archipelago are expected to become sea 
level rise refugees seeking new safe areas to reproduce, feed, and take care of their young. Land use 
decisions and sea level rise adaptation p lanning in the main Hawaiian Islands should consider and 
accommodate the needs of protected species.

209 The NWHIs tangible cultural and he ritage resources, which include historical and archeological sites and 
artifacts, will be negatively affec ted by climate change and sea level rise. More frequent or intense flooding 
and erosion from storms  and high waves  could damage archeological and sacr ed sites on Nihoa and 
Mokumanaman a, potentially  uncover ing or submerg ing iwi kūpuna or ancestral  bones . In addition to the 
vulnerability of tangible cultural and  heritage resources, there are  intangible values associ ated with the 
NWHI;  universal values, Na tive Hawaiian values, heritage values, and values derived from PMNM’s 
opportunity to serve as an exemplar site for science and management.  As in the past, Hawaiian traditional 
ecological knowledge could persist through engaging with changing conditions.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHLI GHTS  
 Develop an archipelagic -wide inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices 
impacted by sea level rise . 
 Develop a culturally -based adaptation process and protocols to preserve Native Hawaiian 
cultural resources and p ractices with sea level rise .

210 POTENIAL LAND LOSS  
Some modelin g efforts, independent of this R eport, have attempted to quantify the potential loss of land  in 
NWHI  due to flooding with sea level rise  (Berkowitz et al. 2012, Krause et al. 2012) . These models 
considered either passive flooding, wave -driven flooding, or a combination of both, to estimate the area 
flooded under scenarios of 3.3 feet or 6.6 feet of sea level rise. On Laysan Isl and, where the mean elevation 
is 14 feet, land loss was estimated between 1.6% (passive flooding only) to 12.0% (wave flooding with 
passive flooding) with 3.3 feet of sea level rise (Berkowitz et al. 2012) . With 6.6 feet of sea level rise, those 
land loss percentages increase to 3.8% and 29.6% respectively (Berkowitz et al. 2012) . On Spit Island, 
which is a part of Midway Atoll and whose mean elevation is 2.6 feet, passive flooding with 3.3 feet of sea 
level rise could cause over 73% land loss and the atoll could be completely submerged with 6.6 feet of sea 
level rise (Krause et al. 2012) . Land loss of this magnitude could force animals who use the island, such as 
seals, turtles, and seabirds, to seek refuge on higher islands such as in the main Hawaiian Islands.  
RECOMMENDATION HIGHL IGHTS  
 Expand the area of national, state, and county parks and wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian 
Islands to preserve wetlands and wildlife . 
Challenges and Opportunities  
Sea level rise , together with potential increased severe storm activity  will render the low -lying atolls, islands, 
and islets extremely vulnerable to passive flooding, high -wave overwash, and coastal erosion . The loss of 
beaches, coastal vegetation, and other habitats , and ultimately complete islands could make the area 
uninhabitable for many of  the unique, threatened, and highly endangered species. While strategies to 
protect some islands through engineering solutions may provide relief for some species, there is a need to 
plan for the migration and accommodation of many wildlife species on the main Hawaiian Islands. This 
migration could add to existing  conflicts between humans and wildlife  on the main Hawaiian Islands . 
Extensive education and outreach , coupled with increased surveillance and enforcement in the main 
Hawaiian Islands will be neede d to ensure that wildlife is able to persist with humans in the face of the 
challenges posed by sea level rise. More detailed modeling and improved monitoring of impacts from 
passive flooding, wave overwash, and coastal erosion should be an integral part o f observing and 
forecasting the sustainability of NWHI terrestrial habitats over the coming decades with climate change and 
sea level rise.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report

SEA LEVEL RISE STORI ES 
Ka‘ena Point, O‘ahu as a Refuge  
EXPANDING PROTECTED HABITAT FOR THREATEN ED AND ENDANGER ED MARINE SPECIES 
WITH SEA LEVEL RISE  
Oahu’s western most extent, Ka‘ena Point Natural Area Reserve has a dream -like quality about it —sapphire 
blue waves wash the rocky shores, native plants cover the white coralline beaches, and the calls of seabirds 
float over the air. The seabirds, such as Laysan albatross and wedge -tailed shearwater, nest in the 
vegetation while not foraging at sea.  
Fortunately, sea level rise is not projected to impact Ka‘ena Point severely, making it an important refuge for 
future cli mate change adaptation as many refugia on low -lying atoll islands in the NWHI will see the effects 
of sea level rise. According to Beth Flint, U .S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge Manager, 
millions of seabirds are at risk from climate ch ange and sea level rise. Rising seas will directly impact their 
ability to nest and raise young in coastal habitats, and the warming of the seas will affect their ability to find 
food. It is imperative to find solutions to such problems now, rather than wa it for these events to reach a 
tipping point. Once a population declines severely, it takes several years to establish new colonies.  
Habitats like Ka‘ena Point provide excellent research venues for wildlife biologists to understand colony 
dynamics, and see k answers to climate change impacts on seabirds . Such refugia also serve as excellent 
education tools.  Most people will never get to see the NWHI due to restricted access. But because Ka‘ena 
Point hosts similar ecosystems to those of the NWHI, it can serve  as a window into the biological and 
cultural importance of the NWHI and inspire more protection of both locations.  
The Ka‘ena Point Natural Area Reserve should continue to be maintained and protected as marine 
mammals and seabirds from the NWHI are forced  to seek refugia in the main Hawaiian Islands. In addition, 
other coastal sites that could serve as potential refugia should be identified and protected —which will 
become increasingly difficult as sea level rise puts pressure on coastal development across the State.

212 Learning Questions for the 5 -Year Report Update  
Learning questions for the Results ch apter  of this Report highlight the need to monitor vulnerability 
assessment results with observations over time. As the results of the vulnerability assessment are based 
on global projections of sea level rise, there is a need to monitor conditions on the ground over time. As 
such, learning questions for the 5 -year Report update include:  
1. To what extent is potential chronic flooding in the SLR -XA with 1.1 foot of sea level rise aligned  
with areas currently exposed to chronic flooding?  
2. Are there any new devel opments or critical infrastructure in the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level 
rise not accounted for in the vulnerability assessment?  
3. To what extent have land and structure values for parcels in areas potentially impacted by sea 
level rise changed as a basi s for estimating potential economic loss?  
4. To what extent has human migration from other Pacific Islands and wildlife migration from the 
NWHI to the main Hawaiian Islands changed?  
5. What adaptation measures have been taken to reduce vulnerability to sea level  rise?  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
213 Recommendations  
‘A‘ohe hana nui ke alu ‘ia. No task is too big when done 
together by all.  
There is a n ‘ōlelo no‘eau, a Hawaiian proverb, that gives insight into 
a clever method that the ancient Hawaiians once used in response 
to flooding —Mānā, i ka pu‘e kalo ho‘one‘ene‘e a ka wai. Translated, 
it means “Mānā, where the mounded taro moves in the water.” Th e 
story behind the proverb takes place in Mānā, Kauaʻi, which was 
once home to deep water kalo (taro) patches that flooded for several 
weeks during the rainy season. To save their crops, the mahiʻai kalo, 
(taro farmers) would construct rafts and paddle out  to the kalo 
patches where they would dive down and carefully wiggle the roots 
of the kalo free from the soil, bringing the kalo to the surface one by 
one. Once the plants were at the surface, they would secure the 
stalks to the rafts so that their leaves could continue to grow above 
water. Eventually, the entire patch became a floating network of rafts 
and kalo plants, thus saving the crops. We must endeavor to be as 
cleaver and resilient as the mahi‘ai kalo.  
This chapter introduces various recommendations  and recommended actions to improve o ur capacity to 
ameliorate the social, economic, and environmental impacts of sea level rise ( Figure 133). The adaptation 
strategies are by no means all -encompassing, and to some  extent, fall short of offering complete solutions 
to the problem of a rising sea, for complete solutions go beyond governance and policy actions. Natural, 
economic, political, and social systems all have a great deal of intrinsic momentum that will challe nge our 
ability to adjust and adapt to this unfolding crisis. At best, we hope that the recommendations and 
recommended actions discussed herein provide a strong basis for the people of Hawaiʻi to continue, in 
earnest, the climate adaption discourse despit e its daunting specter.  
At the onset of the Report , we explained that there is uncertainty in the scientific community on the exact 
timing and rates  of sea level rise. The former ICAC  initially agreed  to accept  the upper -end IPCC projection 
of 1.1 feet of sea level rise by mid -century and 3.2 feet of sea level rise by the end of this century as  planning 
benchmarks out of precaution and to examine what is potentially vulnerable .  
Science and forecasts of sea level rise have evolved rapidly since the 2014 IPCC AR5 and over the three  
years that this Report was developed, with the evolution primarily in the direction of higher sea level 
scenarios. As described in the Sea Level Rise Outlook Chapter, NASA has reported that at least 3 feet of 
sea level rise is inev itable given the GHG  emissions and warming we have already added to the climate 
system, though questions remain around the exact timing of that rise due largely to uncertainties around 
 
Call t o Action  
“We need to teach/educate everyone on 
sea level rise risks and what each 
individual can do to help reduce risks. 
State and county governments should 
incorporate sea level rise risk into all 
infrastructure plans, support smart 
growth, and provide s pace place for 
wildlife to migrate. The results of these 
activities will help make sure people are 
aware of and establish policies and 
programs that help to reduce sea level 
rise risks. ” 
Group message de veloped during the  
1st Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and 
Adaptation Workshop  
O‘ahu , January 2016  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
214 future behavior of Earth’s cryosphere and global GHG emission trajector ies. NOAA’s 2017 report (Sweet 
et al. 2017), which reviewed the most up -to-date scientific literature on sea level rise, describes 3 feet of 
sea level rise in this century as an intermediate scenario and includes a “physically plausible” upper end 
scenario  of over 6 feet of sea level rise by the end of this century . Tidal flooding in 2017  showed us that 1 
foot of sea level rise is a present to near -term scenario that will be experienced with increasing frequency 
and severity over the next few decades. Thus,  as you examine the recommendation s, strategies, and 
actions that follow , please read  them with a sense of urgency. Think about the things we can start today to 
lay groundwork for  a smoother transition to accommodate changing shoreline s. Do not let the unc ertain ty 
of “when and how much” sea level rise  is going to happen  dissuade  you from acting  now. 
At the core of an adaption strategy for Hawai‘i is a commitment to support sustainable and resilient land 
use and community development  (Recommendation 1). Comm unity resiliency should be thought of as a 
core societal value that can serve as the anchor or center of our State’s comprehensive adaption strategy. 
As seen in Figure 133, each recommendation nestles around the anchor, both supporting it and working 
outward from its core . Recommendation 9, “Promote collaboration and accountability for adapting to sea 
level rise ,” provides guidelines to help us collaborate within and between all levels of  government and walks 
of life. Such togetherness, or “‘A‘ohe hana nui ke alu ‘ia ”, might be realized and perpetuated in such things 
as the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission, the City & County of Honolulu Office of Climate Change, Sustainability 
and Resiliency, Hawai‘i Green Growth, and other sustainability and resiliency efforts being undertak en 
throughout the State.

Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
215 Throughout this Chapter, we refer to a “Comprehensive Adaptation Strategy” which may multiple strategies 
such as manag ed retreat, avoidance, and protection. We want to be clear to readers that this is a technical 
report. It is not a comprehensive adaptation  strategy . Recommendations are provided only to highlight 
potential actions and consequences which could be component s of a comprehensive adaptation strategy. 
This strategy should be part of our long -range state -wide planning framework.  
Recommendati on 1:  Supp ort sustainable  and resilient land use and 
community development  
Overview  
Shorefront  communities have valued as sets, such as homes, shopping centers, roads, schools, critical 
infrastructure, and beaches, at risk to chronic flooding. Protection of these built and natural assets from the 
effects of sea level rise is critical to sustaining our State’s long -term health  and well -being. However, t he 
loss of land designated for urban use  due to  sea level rise will increase pressure to convert agricultural and 
conservation lands for urban expansion, and encroaching seas may lead to an increase in the number of 
seawalls and other shoreline protection structures which damage our beaches and intertidal environments . 
It is therefore paramount that government and private sector entities be given appropriate guidance to 
accommodate sea level rise threats to improve sustainability and resilience at community, island, and state 
levels.  
The following Recommended Actions are designed to lay the groundwork for identifying more specific sea 
level rise adaptation strategies that support resilient and sustainable land use and community dev elopment 
and to form the basis for improved flood zone management as well as managed retreat strategies. No 
doubt, hard decisions at all levels of government will need to be made, such as, when to flood proof 
structures in place, vers us when to demolish an d move structures and facilities inland and upward ; whether 
or not to protect development with shoreline hardening, or when to let the sea reclaim the land ; and when, 
where, and how to rezone lands to accommodate managed retreat . Figure 134 provides an example of 
some considerations that could be a part of a comprehensive adaptation  strategy utilizing sustainable and 
resilient land use practices while recognizing the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise3 as a state -wide 
vulnerabi lity zone .  
                                                      
3 For the purposes of this section, all further mentions of the SLR -XA refer to the SLR -XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise. As mentioned 
throughout this Report, the science of sea level rise is dynamic and impacts appear to be coming sooner than later. For insta nce, 
although past predictions indicate at  least 1 foot of sea level rise by 2050, we note in the Sea Level Rise Outlook Chapter that Hawaiʻi 
experienced sea level heights close to 1 foot above predicted astronomical tides with the tidal flooding of 2017. These eleva ted water 
levels were due to lo ng-term sea level rise and shorter -term Pacific -wide climatic and oceanic variability. We can expect extreme 
water levels like this to occur with increasing frequency and severity in the next couple decades with increasing sea level r ise. Thus, 
accommodati ons for sea level rise must be considered today as new development and much of our existing development have 
expected lifespans well into the latter half of this century.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
216  
Figure 134. Support sustainable and resilient land use and community development  
This Report recommends that the State and Counties recognize the SLR -XA as a state -wide vulnerability 
zone for strategic planning purpos es. In planning, recognition and acceptance of vulnerable areas would 
enable policy -makers at all levels of government to take stock of conservation, agriculture, urban, and rural 
land uses at risk from chronic flooding with sea level rise, and to strive t o locate new development outside 
these areas.  
State, county, and community plans w ould need to determine whether to avoid risks by siting development 
outside areas with chronic flooding, to protect existing development through shoreline hardening, to 
acco mmodate new development through floodable design, to retreat from the shoreline by developing 
outside areas of chronic flooding, or to preserve the shoreline allowing landward migration of beaches, 
wetlands, and other natural features. Guidance is needed t o help state, counties, and communities integrate 
sustainable and resilient land use and community development into plans and programs. Community plans 
should serve as a critical entry point for collaborative governance needed to adapt to sea level rise. 
Community planning can facilitate collaboration among federal, state, and county government s and 
communities to plan land use, delivery of government services, and any other matters relating to the 
planning area.  Localized vulnerability assessments, includi ng data from this Report, and a community 
visioning process , are needed as part of this guidance to identify adaptation strategies within and outside 
areas exposed to sea level rise.  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
217 Recommended Actions  
1.1 Recognize the SLR -XA as a state -wide  vulnerability zo ne 
State and County agencies may consider officially recognizing the SLR -XA as  a state -wide vulnerability 
zone  through legislative or executive action. Th is state -wide vulnerability zone  could be employed by 
agencies to formulate comprehensive adaptation s trategies incorporating many of the tools and concepts 
discussed in this chapter.  
As with the Recommendations within this Report, there are priorities, sequencing, and synergies among 
the Recommend Actions. Recommen ded Action  1.1 is considered a priority t hat forms a cornerstone for 
the following recommended action s in this Report. The recognition of the SLR -XA as an actualized 
vulnerability zone is mission critical to the State’s preparedness for and response to sea level rise , and 
should be used as “advis ory” until comprehensive adaptation plans and strategies can be developed and 
adopted at state and county levels.  
In the meantime, t he State and Counties should seek immediate opportunities (low hanging fruit) to 
implement sea level rise adaptation actions , such as, planning new infrastructure outside of the SLR -XA; 
strengthening flood design standards for re -development within the  SLR-XA and other flood hazard areas 
where large -scale managed retreat is infeasible at this time; considering amendments to sta te and local 
land use policies to promote managed retreat from the shoreline where feasible; taking stock of lands 
suitable for future development beyond the SLR -XA; protecting “legacy” coastal areas and beaches from 
inappropriate development; and working with non -governmental sectors to incentivize flood risk avoidance 
and proper real estate disclosure. Finally, as new climate science and methods emerge, the SLR -XA may 
need to be revisited and revised, necessitating a “phased” approach to long -term sea lev el rise adaptation. 
However, this adaptive management process should not be used as an excuse to delay action. It is highly 
recommended that, in recognizing a state -wide vulnerability zone, readers remember that sea level rise 
does not stop at 3.2 feet or at the end of this century. Communities and policy -makers are encouraged to 
consider long -range planning for anticipated future sea level rise beyond 3.2 feet, particularly for the most 
critical infrastructure and resources.  
1.2 Seek opportunities to plan new development  outside  of the SLR -XA under  long -term, 
comprehensive managed retreat strateg y  
It is paramount that we recognize the inherent threat of sea level rise to our coastal communities. Continued 
investment in new housing development, commercial areas , and critical infrastructure  that are located in 
the SLR -XA must be weighed against the timing and extent of flooding from sea level rise. Efforts must be 
made to locate new development landward of this vulnerability zone wherever possible . The Results 
Chapter of this Report (Chapter 4) estimates economic losses from 1 .1 foot and 3.2 feet of sea level rise if 
no adaption measures are taken. For instance, the Island of  O‘ahu could experience losses (property and 
structures) of $13 billion with 3.2 feet of s ea level rise, but this number does not include losses from 
infrastructure damage and maintenance, loss of business opportunities, and loss of our (in)valuable 
beaches and other natural resources. Without a comprehensive adaptation strategy that includes p re-Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
218 planning, incentives, and financing for managed retreat from the shoreline, chronic flooding of structures, 
land, and businesses would result in unsustainable economic losses in coastal real estate and i ncreasing 
maintenance costs for infrastructure sit ed along our coasts (i.e. airports, wastewater treatment facilities , 
roads , etc.) . These and other factors should be considered when we weigh the benefits and costs of 
permitting development in areas potentially exposed to chronic flooding against the sign ificant up -front costs 
required to move development landward of the areas vulnerable to sea level rise.  
1.3 Conduct an inventory of existing lands  designated for urban use  that are located outside of 
the SLR -XA and prioritize these areas for new development  
The Office of Planning, together with the Counties, should conduct a lands inventory to identify lands that 
are available for development or redevelopment within an urban growth boundary, but outside of the SLR -
XA. The goal of this process is to identify, as sess, and prioritize underutilized land within urban zoned areas 
that could represent opportunities for redevelopment that would be resilient to sea level rise. Once the 
inventory is completed and development capacities are estimated utilizing sustainable and resilient land 
use practices, there should be an assessment of potential developable lands outside of urban growth 
boundaries suitable for future development (e.g., managed retreat). The inventory should also include a 
review of any existing redevelopm ent plans and other related plans and studies to assess consistency with 
goals related to sea level rise and managed retreat.  
For each existing urban zoned area, a variety of factors and existing conditions should be evaluated to 
determine suitability for development or redevelopment including: total land area, current buildout, 
vacant/underutilized parcels, flood and other hazard areas, infrastructure capacity and condition, current 
zoning, and compatibility with existing uses and community plans. Maps, da ta and qualitative information 
should be used to aid in the process of inventorying underutilized parcels that could become a key 
component of a long -term redevelopment and managed retreat strategy. Stakeholder engagement should 
also be used to provide nec essary insight to further refine an understanding of the priority sites on which to 
focus future development efforts.  
The inventory should include, but not be  limited to the following factors:  
 Existing land use classification and ownership;  
 Historic land use patterns;  
 Critical land uses such as agriculture and conservation for water resources;  
 Areas that are currently eroding;  
 Areas where shoreline armoring is already in place;  
 Areas that have a high potential for landward migration;  
 Areas of particular so cial, cultural, economic, and environmental value;  
 Areas currently supporting critical infrastructure; and  
 Anticipated vulnerability and timing of the area to sea level rise impacts;  
This process should include the identification of existing assets in urba n areas that could  be leveraged to 
support smart redevelopment in areas not vulnerable to sea level rise. This should include the identification Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
219 of key local and regional assets that c ould be capitalized on to catalyze redevelopment and private 
investment in desirable areas. These assets c ould include the unique characteristics and amenities of the 
area, anchor institutions, large -scale public infrastructure, terrain and physical conditions, tourist attractions, 
and recent and planned real estate developmen t among others.  
Constraints to potential redevelopment in each area should also be evaluated , including flood hazard areas, 
sensitive environmental resources such as beaches and wetlands, conservation areas, agricultural lands 
of importance, and existing infrastructure capacity and condition. This inventory would help identify areas 
which are most suitable for re-development and c ould then be evaluated and prioritized as part of an overall 
smart urban redevelopment managed retreat strategy (see Recommendat ion 3).  
1.4 Strive to balance managed retreat strategies from vulnerable urban areas with preservation 
of agriculture and conservation lands by relying on state planning act policies and tools and 
the State Land Use Commission boundary review process.  
The Hawa i‘i State Land Use Law classifies all lands in the State as urban, rural, agricultural, or conservation , 
specifying uses and activities within district boundaries. Since the law was enacted, changes in land use 
districts have been approved as a result of i ndividual reclassification petitions and three 5 -year boundary 
review amendments (State of Hawai‘i Office of Planning 2006) . 
The Hawaiʻi State Land Use Commission (LUC) is responsible for implementing the Hawai‘i State Land 
Use Law and is responsible for establishing and amending the land use district boundaries for the entire 
State. This makes them vital to a smart, managed ret reat strategy. As it is the LUC’s job to  act on petitions 
for land use boundary changes submitted by private landowners, developers, and state and county 
agencies, they  should be given specific legislative authority to develop an explicit policy to address  
managed retreat onto agriculture and conservation land s that supports the State’s sustainability goals  and 
protects these lands to the greatest extent possible . Actions that  seek to re designate  agriculture and 
conservations lands should  include strict per formance guidelines that minimize urban sprawl, promote 
energy and transportation efficiencies, avoid hazards , and protect important agricultural lands and natural 
resources.  
Further, the LUC should be granted specific legislative authority  through  HRS  Chapters 205 to amend the 
State Land Use District classifications to not only accommodate urban expansion into areas outside of the 
SLR-XA, but to also direct growth to appropriate areas in ways that reduce sprawl, reduce hazard exposure, 
and preserve enviro nmentally sensitive, culturally significant, and agriculturally important areas. The 
information presented in this Report provides data, assessments, and recommendations that form a 
practical and factual basis from which the LUC could support and act upon a managed retreat strategy as 
part of a subsequent boundary review. Special attention should be given in this review to identify and 
strengthen protections for agricultural and conservation lands  needed to support sustainable and resilient 
communities . 
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
220 1.5 Integrat e sea level rise  adaptation plans and policies  into state, county and community 
plans  
The Hawai‘i State Planning Act  (HRS Chapter 226) was amended in 2012 with the addition of the Climate 
Change Adaptation Priority Guidelines (Act 286). These guideli nes were created to encourage  the 
collaboration needed to address climate change , recognizing that impacts will occur to multiple sectors 
including agriculture, conservation lands, coastal and nearshore marine areas, natural and cultural 
resources, educati on, higher education, energy, health, historic preservation, water resources, the built 
environment, and the economy (State of Hawai'i Senate 2012).   
As the Hawai‘i State Planning Act identifies the Office of Planning  as the agency that shall provide techn ical 
assistance in administering this law, the Office of Planning , together with its partners, should develop 
specific guidance for applying the Climate Adaptation Priority Guidelines of the State Planning Act (HRS 
§226 -109) and  the recommendations /recomme nded actions  from this Report to address sea level rise 
impacts in plans and programs within the state planning system . The guidance should help planners, 
together with communities, integrate the best available science and methodologies for assessing our 
State’s vulnerability to coastal hazards with sea level rise and identify and evaluate  adaptation options 
including managed retreat. A community visioning process is needed as part of this guidance that would 
help planners and communities envision an aspira tional future including sea level rise adaption to generate 
social awareness, ownership, and acceptance of the needs and opportunities of achieving that vision. A 
phased and incremental planning process may be necessary with triggers for implementing speci fic 
strategies  such as th ose adopted by the California Coastal Commission  (ESA 2016, California Coastal 
Commission 2015) . Updated p lans should support the overall goal of sustainable and resilient community 
development. This guidance should  also be reviewed and adopted by the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission.  
Further, the Office of Planning  should  periodically  review selected State and County plans and programs 
for consistency with the Climate Adaptation Priority Guidelines  as well as future policies t hat may be 
developed, and report the status of its implementation to the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission .  
Federal, state, and counties around the United States are developing similar guidance and tools to support 
sustainable and resilient land use and communit y development. For example, FEMA  has developed  
guidance for integrating risk into g enera l, comprehen sive, and land use p lans (FEMA 2015) . FEMA’s 
guidance encourages integration or the two-way exchange of information and incorporation of ideas and 
concepts between hazard mitigation plans (state and local) and other community plans. California’s Gene ral 
Plan guidelines require that sea level rise exposure be considered as a factor in developing an inventory of 
land suitable for development (State of California 2017) . In addition, the California Coastal Commission has 
developed guidelines for addressing sea leve l rise in local coastal programs and coastal development 
permits (California Coastal Commission 2015, 2017) . 
1.6 Develop shoreline protection, conservation , and restoration priorities and guidelines  
Shoreline armor ing is either prohibited or heavily discouraged under the Hawai‘i CZM Act unless a statutory 
exemption is in place or a waiver has been obtained. The DLNR and Office of Planning , along with the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
221 Counties, should identify near -term and long -term shoreline co nservation and restoration priorities to 
support adaptation to sea level rise. Each island has existing shoreline armoring that includes seawalls, 
floodwalls, bulkheads, revetments, and other similar structures that are used to protect infrastructure and 
property. These structures have had an overall negative impact on beach resources and public shoreline 
access. While Hawai ‘i state law currently prohibits or discourages hard armoring, it is likely that pressure 
for such variances would increase as the effe cts of sea level rise become more pronounced. Proactive 
policies and guidelines are needed to combat reactive or emergency variances that are implemented in a 
piecemeal fashion and that may not be in the public interest, cost -effective, or successful.  
A systematic assessment and decision -making framework is needed to identify shoreline conservation and 
restoration priorities that is holistic, transparent, and incorporates stakeholder feedback. This decision -
making framework would need to be reconciled with  natural and cultural resources conservation priorities 
and recommendations (see Recommendations 5 and 6). County regulations and guidelines should be 
reviewed and revised in the context of these priorities. Shoreline armoring variances should be an option  
of last resort and conditioned to minimize risk of adverse impacts on beach processes. Variances could 
similarly be conditioned to prohibit future repairs and to not allow property owners to seek variances or 
permits to expand or strengthen such structure s in the future. County ordinances could also require property 
owners to consider relocation of residences and non -structural or soft -armoring protection methods before 
hard armoring structures are even considered. In addition, significant fees and lease p ayments for shoreline 
armoring structures could be put in place to discourage hard armoring, and also serve as revenues to 
agencies to help underwrite the cost of adaptation planning. Further, state and local governments could 
adopt policies generally favo ring non -structural armoring, such as beach nourishment, over hard armoring 
as a shoreline protection measure.  Finally, the real estate industry should consider new disclosure 
guidelines for properties located in vulnerable areas.  
Recommendation 2:  Prioritize smart urban re development outside 
the SLR -XA and limit exposure within the SLR -XA  
Overview  
Highly urbanized areas along the coast will be severely impacted by chronic flooding with sea level rise. In 
a recent study, experts and residents of flooded c ommunities in the U nited States defined the threshold of 
chronic flooding that would disrupt peo ple’s daily lives and routines  to be when 10 % of a town or city's 
useable land experiences flooding 26 or more times each year (Spanger -Siegfried et al. 2017) . The 
potential for fragmented and unsustainable development would be expected over time as more urban areas 
become chronically flooded.  In island environments where land is highly limited, a  proactive and smart 
urban redevelopment strategy is needed to adapt to changing conditions, protect lives and property, offer 
a good quality of life, and promote a thriving economy now and in the future  (EPA 2017) . 
Smart urban redevelopment is a core element of a sea level  rise adaptation. A first step would be to evaluate 
existing policies and institutional capacity for implementing smart redevelopment state -wide. This would Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
222 also include identifying any regulatory and policy barriers as well as any fiscal challenges that m ay hinder 
smart redevelopment. Further, consideration of societal disparities such as ensuring affordable housing, as 
well as timing uncertainty of sea level rise projections would present challenges.  Using the results of a land 
inventory (see Recommended Action 1.3), target areas for smart redevelopment should be located outside 
of the SLR -XA. Market studies and detailed redevelopment strategies are also needed to enable capital 
improvement planning for infrastructure. Examples of recommended actions to su pport smart urban 
redevelopment outside the SLR -XA and limit exposure inside the SLR -XA are provided in Figure 135 and 
Figure 136, respectively.  
 
Figure 135. Prioritize smart urb an redevelopment outside the SLR -XA 
Recommended Actions  
2.1 Evaluate existing policies and institutional capacity of implementing smart redevelopment  
Smart redevelopment  strategies help communities grow in ways that expand economic opportunity while 
protecting  human health and the environment. Smart growth promotes efficient and sustainable land 
development, incorporates redevelopment patterns that optimize prior infrastructure investments, and 
consumes less land that is otherwise available for agriculture, ope n space, natural systems, and rural 
lifestyles.  The State, through Act 130, Session Laws of Hawai‘i 2016 (Senate Bill 3077) designates the 
Office of Planning  as the lead state agency to coordinate and advance smart growth and transit -oriented 
development ( TOD) planning in the State. TOD is a great example of smart growth as it is a type of 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
223 community development that includes mixed -uses (housing, office, retail, etc.) in a walkable neighborhood 
that is located near quality public transportation. It may also involve redevelopment of existing facilities or 
may involve new development. An example of this is the City & County of Honolulu’s TOD program. The 
establishment of the Honolulu rail transit system u nder Ordinance 07 -01, paved the way for Ordinance 09 -
04 which established the City’s TOD program and enabled the creation of special districts around each rail 
transit station (within 2 ,000 feet from the station). Each station will have its own unique identity as each 
TOD development is intended to fit the surro unding community’s context. To ensure this, each station area 
will involve the preparation of a neighborhood TOD plan that includes implementing regulations along with 
extensive community participation.  
Similar to how the State and City & County of Honolul u have passed laws to facilitate, coordinate , and 
advanc e smart growth and TOD planning, the state and counties should continue to r eview existing policies 
and regulatory processes to assess whether the current  framework supports  smart redevelopment of urb an 
areas as part of sea level rise adaptation planning . Where appropriate , opportunities  should be identified  
for amendments that would  encourage and incentivize private investment, redevelopment of priority areas  
outside of the SLR -XA, a healthy mix of us es, and appropriate economic growth an d development. Potential 
updates may include revisions that promote diverse housing stock, allow for increased density in 
appropriate areas, require consideration for future conditions, support TOD, and improve the eff iciency of 
development approval processes, among others.  
The New York City (NYC) Office of Environmental Remediation provides a  good  example of efforts to review 
redevelopment planning to increase resilience . The NYC  Office of Environmental Remediation con ducted 
climate resiliency and green remediation and development audits of cleanup and redevelopment plans for 
projects in the NYC  Voluntary Cleanup Program (formerly known as  the NYC  Brownfields Program) (NYC 
Office of Environmental Remediation 2017) . The audits focus ed on reviewing plans for remediation and 
redevelopment submitted by deve lopment teams  and identified best management practices (BMPs) and 
other items with potential to improve those plans with respect to “green and sustainable” considerati ons. 
Subjects of the audits include d: encourage d attention to climate resilience, improved energy efficiency and 
reduced emissions, improved water use efficiency and reduced runoff, optimize d material use with utilizing 
green materials, minimize d waste (in cluding recycling and reuse), encourage d green design and improve d 
quality of environment, optimiz ed remediation, and development of a culture of sustainability . One of the 
primary goals of the audits was to increase resiliency by informing the development  teams of other 
programs that could  provide information and benefits regarding green and sustainable approach es.  
2.2 Identify priority areas  for smart redevelopment as part of a managed retreat strategy  
An unbiased evaluation of urban areas vulnerable to sea level rise should be conducted to establish priority 
redevelopment areas for managed retreat. A committee should be established to conduct a detailed risk 
analysis using the vulnerability assessment results of this Report, the lands inventory as suggested in 
Recommended Action 1.2, and the shoreline conservation priorities as described in Recommended Action 
1.6 that could then be used to develop prioritization  criteria. The detailed risk analysis  should also  consider Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
224 other factors such as quantify ing potent ial loss (i.e., structural loss , economic loss such as income level  
and social justice , loss jobs/wages, loss tax, etc.) which could  be one component of the prioritization 
methodology. Areas would be ranked using  the committee -identified criteria and spati al analyses (clusters, 
hot-spot, etc .) to help determine the order of investment to retreat or adapt. A prioritized action plan should 
also be developed to identify the most at -risk infrastructure a nd include corresponding  adaptation options 
as well as funding sources for implementation. During this evaluation, outreach should be conducted with 
property owners to discuss potential incentives that would encourage retreat from areas vulnerable to future 
sea level rise , particularly for shoreline areas that ha ve been identified as priority shoreline conservation 
areas (Recommended Action 1.6) .  
2.3 Conduct a market study for  priority  redevelopment areas  
The State and Counties should develop a comprehensive regional market assessment that provides 
defensible estimat es of current market conditions and opportunities for supportable future growth across 
various economic sectors. The market assessment would help signify opportunities for appropriate new 
growth and development and should include analyses to validate and c onsider the depth of the market for 
a diversity of potential uses by analyzing workforce, demographic, and economic data sets, and identify 
current and emerging local economic base industries. The assessment should include quantitative and 
qualitative info rmation that would collectively present a comprehensive assessment of the market and 
define supportable residential, commercial, and industrial development potential.  
2.4 Develop detailed redevelopment strategies  for priority  areas and incentivize development  
The State and Counties should create redevelopment strategies for priority urban areas that reflect the 
findings from the redevelopment and market assessments conducted in Recommend ed Actions 2 .2 and 
2.3. The primary result of these efforts should be detai led strategies for each priority  area that illustrate 
feasible approaches to potential redevelopment. The State and Counties should use cumulative information 
gathered for each priority area and identified reuse sites to recommend the most effective redeve lopment 
strategies based on a variety of criteria, including physical conditions, hazard areas, desired scale and 
density, and the ability to achieve established goals and objectives.  
Within each priority  redevelopment area, a more detailed , site-level as sessment should be conducted to 
recommend t he highest and best use for priority  redevelopment site s. To the extent that it is readily 
available, basic information about each site should be collected  including , but not limited to, parcel number, 
current or former use, estimated size, basic description of the location, current ownership, current zoning, 
and existing infrastructure servicing the property .  
Detailed redevelopment strategies should then be developed for each area which include  specific 
recommend ations that are tailored to unique local conditions and designed to support the realization of the 
vision and goals outlined during this process . Potential actions that may support successful redevelopment 
of priority areas may include but are not limited to: Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
225  Providing incentives for infill development that make private investment more efficient and 
desirable in existing urban areas not exposed to sea level rise. Examples of potential incentives 
include, but are not limited to: (a) expediting permitting/app rovals, (b) fee waivers, (c) flexible 
zoning incentives, (d) parking initiatives (shared parking, payment in lieu of parking, etc.), (e) tax 
relief/abatements, (f) public funding assistance;  
 Amending zoning ordinances and specific property classifications  as necessary to support 
redevelopment and private investment, and to ensure a healthy mix of uses. This may include 
updating existing ordinances to adjust allowable uses, densities, scale of development, floor area 
ratios, setbacks, and conservation requi rements, among other provisions;  
 Identifying and prioritizing opportunities to focus redevelopment around existing infrastructure;  
 Identifying and planning for necessary infrastructure expansions or upgrades to support new 
development;  
 Implementing public realm improvements to support walkability and desirability of development 
areas;  
 Preserving historic assets and encouraging adaptive reuse to retain local character, create a 
sense of place , and encourage development in desirable areas;  
 Implementing a tran sfer of development rights (TDR) program that designates formal “receiving” 
areas within priority  growth areas not exposed to sea level rise; and  
 Coordinating land swaps to relocate development from hazard areas to safer areas. Land swaps 
are an exchange o f municipally owned land for privately owned land, used to strategically 
assemble and re -purpose large areas to increase resilience through conservation, open space, 
green infrastructure, and more.  
2.5 Update capital improvement planning to incorporate sea lev el rise and prioritize infrastructure 
improvements for priority redevelopment areas  
Identify  and plan for  public infrastructure improvements necessary to support grow th/redevelopment of 
priority areas. Improvement projects should be outlined in a capital i mprovement plan and should include 
the full range of infrastructure necessary to support redevelopment including transportation assets, storm 
water facilities, sewer and potable water, utilities, telecommunications, as well as  pedestrian and publi c 
realm i mprovements/amenities.  
2.6 Develop design standards for existing and proposed land uses that limits urban growth and 
increases flood resiliency within the SLR -XA 
The State and Counties should develop d esign standards applicable for managing flood risk within the SLR-
XA (Figure 136). These design standards would be developed and applied as BMPs and may or may not 
be regulatory in nature.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
226  
Figure 136. Limit exposure inside the SLR -XA 
2.7 Require the  design and sit ing of  planned new development and  capital improvement projects 
to include  an in -depth analysis of sea level rise impacts based on elevation, tolerance for risk, 
and lifetime of the structure   
State and Counties should adopt a review and approval process t o ensure that new development and 
capital improvement projects with an expected life span of 30 years or more are designed and sited to 
address the impacts of sea level rise utilizing the SLR -XA as a vulnerability zone  (see Recommended Action 
1.1). All pla nned new development and critical infrastructure located within areas potentially exposed to 
chronic flooding with sea level rise should be subject to an in -depth analysis of the potential impacts of sea 
level rise on elevation, risk tolerance, and lifetim e of the structure . Any redevelopment within existing 
footprints should be dependent on established, resilient building design guidelines, or otherwise be subject 
to relocation to a more suitable area.  
  
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
227 2.8 Develop State and County guidance and a checklist f or developers to assist with the 
integration of sea level rise in project design and encourage the use of best management 
practices for incorporating green and sustainable approaches  in all stages of project 
development  
As a part of a sea level rise adapt ation strategy, the State and Counties should provide guidance and a 
checklist that would help developers integrate sea level rise in their project designs, permits and planning 
applications. In addition, the guidance document(s) and/or checklist should id entify  BMPs , offer design 
considerations and protection measures/techniques, provide tools/resources available to imp rove 
development plans, and reference GIS resources (e.g., sea level rise overlays). It should also encourage 
the incorporation of green an d sustainable approaches such as: improved energy e fficiency and reduced 
emissions;  improved water use efficiency and reduced runoff;  optimize d material use with utilizing green 
materials;  minimize d waste (including recycling and reuse), and encourage d green design and improve d 
quality of environment.  
2.9 Develop guidance on integrating sea level rise and climate change in the environmental 
review process  and incorporating environmental justice considerations  
The Hawaiʻi Environmental Impact Statement Law (HRS  Chapter 343)  and the Hawai‘i Environmental 
Impact Statement Rules ( Hawaiʻi Administrative Rule s §11-200) requires any agency (for government 
actions) or person (for individual/private actions) , that needs  to obtain agency approval prior to proceeding 
with implementing actions located in certain specified areas or actions that require certain types of 
amendments to existing county general plans , to undergo an  environmental review  process. The  
environmental review process is triggered should a proposed proj ect fall within one of the nine established 
categories of action pursuant to HRS §343 -5 and HAR §11 -200-6. The purpose of an environmental 
assessment is to disclose potential environmental, social, and economic impacts of a proposed project 
based on an ana lysis of the current environment with or without the project .  
The State of Hawaiʻi , Office of Environmental Quality Control (OEQC) should issue  specific guidance on 
integrating sea level rise and climate change in the environmental review process. Guidanc e on sea level 
rise should highlight the need for analysis of the proposed action  in terms of design and siting to address 
the impacts of sea level rise utilizing the SLR -XA as a vulnerability zone. G uidance  on integrating climate 
change sh ould highlight t he need for analysis of the proposed action in the context of the future state of the 
environment. This guidance should be modeled after new federal guidance issued by the U.S. Council on 
Environmental Quality for federal departments and agencies on consid eration of GHG  emissions and the 
effects of climate change (State of Hawaiʻi OEQC 2016) . Further, t here is a need to address the 
disproportionate environmental bur dens borne by marginalized, underrepresented, or otherwise vulne rable 
communities from projects  as environmental justice  concerns are likely to be exacerbated as sea level rise 
results in changes in land use and development.  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
228 2.10 Integr ate sea level rise vulnerability considerations into  the Hawaiʻi Coastal Zone Management  
(CZM)  Act  
The Hawaiʻ i CZM Act (HRS Chapter 205A) is an important planning tool for guiding land use development 
within the coastal zo ne. It should be noted that for Hawai‘i, the CZM area encompasses the entire State as 
there is no point of land more than 30 miles from the ocean. The Office of Planning  is the State’s designated 
lead agency tasked with coordinating  activities  within the CZM areas  state -wide. In addition, u nder the CZM 
Act, counties are tasked with establish ing SMA boundaries and exercise authority over permits and 
variances within the SMA .  
The Hawaiʻi CZM Act and the SMAs are existing tools that can be used to encourage appropriate 
development in areas exposed to coastal hazards with sea level rise. This could be achieved by amending 
the Hawaiʻi CZM law related to SMA guidelines  to consider  sea le vel rise vulnerability and to support the 
development of managed retreat strategies. Currently, there are ten objectives : (1) recreational resources ; 
(2) h istoric resources ; (3) scenic and open space resources ; (4) coastal ecosystems ; (5) e conomic us es; 
(6) c oastal hazards ; (7) m anaging development ; (8) p ublic participation ; (9) b each protection ; and (10) 
marine resources . 
Specifically, the CZM Act  could be amended to  these and other provisions:  
 Include sea level rise and specify adaptation strategies  for accommodation, protection, and/or 
retreat in response to sea level rise  within the Act’s objectives and policies;  
 Integrate  environmental justice considerations ; 
 Consider language that results in more restrictive conditions on variances and SMA permit s or 
modifying laws and rules to make variances and permits more difficult to obtain within the SLR -XA 
as a vulnerability zone  (see Recommended Action 1.1) ; and  
 Adopt rolling easement policies that facilitate managed retreat from the shoreline.  
In additio n, State and County agencies  may choose to adopt and enforce rules that comply with the Act’s  
objectives and policies.   
Recommendation 3:  Incentivize improved flood risk management  
Overview  
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP ) is a federal program,  which was established to allow property 
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protections against losses from flooding. 
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government 
that states , if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood 
risks to new construction and substantial improvements in Special Flood Hazard Areas, the federal 
government will make flood insurance available within the com munity at a low cost. The NFIP is 
administered by the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, formerly the Federal Insurance Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
229 Administration and the Mitigation Directorate, components of the FEMA.  The DLNR  has been designated 
as the State Coordinat ing Agency responsible for assisting the coordination of the program between the 
federal and county agencies in Hawai ‘i. All four  of our Counties are participating communities in the NFIP 
and each community has a representative  County Floodplain Manager  that should be consulted for building 
permit -related questions.  
Financial exposure to coastal flooding could be further reduced by increasing participation in the NFIP 
Community Rating System (CRS) program and encouraging at -risk property owners to purchase flood 
insurance. The CRS program is voluntary and recognizes and encourages community floodplain 
management activities that exceed the minimum NFIP standards. Depending upon the level of participation, 
flood insurance premium rates for policyholders can be  reduced up to 45%. Besides the benefit of reduced 
insurance rates, CRS floodplain management activities enhance public safety, reduce damages to property 
and public infrastructure, avoid economic disruption and losses, reduce human suffering, and protect the 
environment. Participating in the CRS also provides an incentive to maintaining and improving a 
community's floodplain management program over the years. Further, implementing some CRS activities 
can help projects qualify for other Federal assistance p rograms.  
An immediate measure to reduce disaster spending would be to encourage property owners, outside 
historically based flood hazard zones, to purchase flood insurance as it has been proven that hazard 
mitigation is critical to reducing disaster risks and spending. FEMA reports that for every $1 spent on 
mitigation, it saves society an average of $4.  In addition, the federal government has recognized the 
importance of hazard mitigation through the passing of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106 -
390) which provides the legal basis for FEMA mitigation planning requirements for state and local 
governments as a condition of mitigation grant assistance. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 also 
amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act by repealing the previous 
mitigation planning provisions and replacing them with a new set of requirements that emphasize the need 
for state and local entities to closely coordinate mitigation planning and implementation efforts. The Act 
further established a new requirement for local mitigation plans and authorized up to 7% of Hazard 
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds to be available to a State for development of State and local 
mitigation plans.   
The purpose of the HMGP is to  help communities implement hazard mitigation measures following a 
Presidential Major Disaster Declaration in the areas of the state requested by the Governor. The key 
purpose of this grant program is to enact mitigation measures that reduce the risk of lo ss of life and property 
from future disasters. Mitigation includes long -term efforts to reduce the impact of future events. HMGP 
recipients have the primary responsibility for prioritizing, selecting, and administering state and local hazard 
mitigation pro jects. Although individuals may not apply directly to the state for assistance, local 
governments may sponsor an application on their behalf.  
Pre-disaster recovery planning can also provide opportunities for communities to build back better when 
difficult decisions about rebuilding are made before a disaster  even strikes . The fundamental key to this Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
230 approach is answering the question, “Do we want to build it back?” Pre -disaster recovery planning helps to 
identify these opportunities before a disaster takes place. Disaster scenarios based on potential impacts 
from hurricanes and tsunamis, and even sea level rise , provide opportunities to consider enhanced 
resilience and adaptation.  It is important to note that every disaster creates an opportunity to correct prior 
land use decisions based on new information on risk.  However, to leverage those opportunities, there must 
be an incentive at the state and local level  as the notion of an action being  the “right thing to do” is not 
enough. Strengthening rebuilding re strictions could foster safer redevelopment of disaster -stricken 
shoreline areas consistent with sea level rise adaptation objectives.  Examples of recommended actions to 
incentivize improved flood risk management are shown in  Figure 137. 
 
Figure 137. Incentivize improved flood risk management  
Recommended Actions  
3.1 Adopt higher flood standards to account for sea level rise  
The State should adopt higher flood standards to account for sea level rise and potent ial future 
redevelopment. Other states in the nation have adopted higher standards to account for potential future 
development , such as t he State of New Jersey . New Jersey has decided to  delineate a “flood hazard area 
design flood ” (State of New Jersey 2017a)  which is defined as a flood equal to the 100 -year flood plus an 
additional amount of water in fluvial areas to account for possible future increases in flow due to 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
231 development or other factors. This additional amount of water also provides a factor of safety in cases when 
the 100 -year flood is exceede d. Th e New Jersey Flood Hazard Design Flood is depicted on FIRMs and is 
used to regulate the permitting process and address design and construction standards for activities in and 
near surface waters. Other states have adopted sea level rise projections to  guide future planning efforts 
and to be considered for certain permit and funding programs. For example,  the New York State , 
Department of Environmental Conservation introduced the Community Risk and Resilie ncy Act (New York 
State Department of Environmental Conservation 2017)  which requires permit and certain funding 
applicants demonstrate that future physical climate risk due to sea level rise , storm surge and flooding have 
been considered. Further, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation adopted sea 
level rise projections on a regional basis (6 NYCRR Part 490, Projected Sea -level Rise).  
3.2 Consider adopting V zone construction  standards in the Coastal A Zone  
Flood risk zones subject to inundation from the 1% -annual chance flood are designated as SFHAs on the 
FIRMs produced by FEMA. SFHAs along coasts subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event 
with additional haz ards associated with storm -induced waves subject to coastal inundation are designated 
as V zones. Coastal A zones are areas landward of a V zone or landward of an open coast without mapped 
V zones. In a Coastal A zone, the principal source of flooding is f rom astronomical tides, storm surges, 
seiches, or tsunamis. Currently, the minimum NFIP standards do not require that structures located in 
Coastal A zones be constructed to withstand coastal flood hazards such as high velocity flows, wave action, 
erosion and scour; however, individual communities may adopt higher regulatory standards that require 
such considerations in building design. At the time of next update, FEMA will determine the limit of moderate 
wave action  (LiMWA). The LiMWA is the landward exten t of the Coastal A zone for each county’s FIRM. 
Delineating the Coastal A zone and LiMWA on the effective FIRM is voluntary; however, it should be noted 
that displaying the Li MWA on FIRMs  is a pre -requisite for participation in  the CRS.  
3.3 Provide technical and financial support to a state -wide  Community Rating System  program  
FEMA identifies flood hazards and assesses flood risks and partners with states and communities to 
develop FIRM s as part of the NFIP for developing regulations and flood insurance require ments. As FEMA 
updates Flood Insurance Study  and updates hazard zones, many landowners would  be required to 
purchase flood insurance and meet more costly construction standards. As stated earlier, t he CRS is a 
voluntary p rogram that provides flood insuranc e premium discounts in recognition of flood risk management 
program elements that exceed the minimum requirements of the NFIP. Creditable activities include: land 
acquisitions  and restoration to open space uses , relocation, flood -proofing, open space prese rvation, and 
other measures that reduce flood damages. If a county participates in the CRS, residents may qualify for 
discounted flood insurance.  
It is recommended that the State Legislature consider requiring all counties to participate in the CRS and 
provide annual funding to support CRS participation.  This in turn would encourage the Counties to strive 
to advance their CRS rating to reduce impacts and repetitive loss from flooding and enable homeowners 
to obtain discounted flood insurance.  It should b e noted that while all four counties currently participate in Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
232 the NFIP, only the County of Maui and the County of Hawaii are active CRS communities. Participation in 
a state -wide CRS program could also be tied to the Community Assistance Program administer ed by the 
DLNR under the NFIP as the State of Hawaii's Floodplain Coordinating Agency.  The Community 
Assistance Program provides funding to states to provide technical assistance to communities participating 
in the NFIP and to evaluate community performan ce in implementing NFIP floodplain management 
activities. The Community Assistance Program helps to ensure that the flood loss reduction goals of the 
NFIP are met, build state and community floodplain management expertise and capability, and leverage 
state  knowledge and expertise in working with their communities. This recommendation is based on the 
understanding that the full responsibility for the commitment to participate and maintain status in the CRS 
program lies with the individual county and that the  State's role would be to support those efforts defined 
above.  It should be noted that many recommendations in this Report could potentially provide CRS credits.  
Support from the State could include the following : 
 Address community compliance issues.  
 CRS  application and annual recertification support.  
 Facilitate the identification and crediting of state -wide uniform minimum credits under CRS.  
 Facilitate the formation and implementation of a CRS Users Group.  
 Develop a state -wide model flood damage prevent ion ordinance that includes CRS creditable 
elements for sea level rise provisions.  
 Support the development and maintenance of all local and state hazard mitigation plans and 
assure that they are developed such that they are creditable under the CRS program . 
 Support the development of a state -wide program for public involvement that is creditable under 
the CRS Activity 330.  
 Continue to mine the best available data and science on all flood risk within the State.  
 Support the Counties in the capture of perishab le data that memorializes flood risk following flood 
events.  
It is understood under this recommendation that the full responsibility for the commitment to participate and 
maintain status in the CRS program lies with each individual county and that the State’s role under this 
recommendation would be to support those efforts as defined above. It should be noted that many 
recommendations in this Report could potentially provide CRS credits.  
3.4 Encourage property owners at risk to coastal flooding to purchase floo d insurance  
Coastal flooding from high tides and annual high waves results in damage to structures and their contents. 
With sea level rise, many new properties located outside of FEMA -established coastal flood zones, where 
flood insurance is required to o btain a mortgage, could become exposed to coastal flooding from high tides, 
annual high waves, hurricanes and tropical cyclones. The success of this recommendation would be tied Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
233 to Recommended Action 3.3 as the cost of flood insurance in these zones would be more  affordable based 
on the positive impacts on flood insurance premiums from participation in the CRS program.  
3.5 Incorporate sea level rise into state and county hazard mitigation plans  
Hazard mitigation is the use of long -term and short -term policies, programs, projects, and other activities to 
reduce death, injury, and property damage that can result from a disaster. State and county hazard 
mitigation plans should incorporate  the findings of this Report, where appropriate.  
In additional, local hazard mitigations plans  could be assembled such that components of the plan s could 
qualify as Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG -DR) Program Action Plan s 
following a declared disaster where CDBG -DR funding has been made available. The CDBG -DR program 
provides flexible grants to help cities, counties, and states recover from presidentially declared disasters, 
especially in low -income areas. Grantees may use CDBG -DR funds for recovery efforts involving housing, 
economic development, infrastru cture and prevention of further damage to affected areas for low -income 
residents in and around communities that have experienced a natural disaster. Eligible governments must 
develop and submit a Disaster Recovery Action Plan before receiving CDBG -DR gran ts. The action plan 
must include a needs assessment, strategies, and projected uses of the disaster recovery funds.  
3.6 Adopt a state -wide  program that supports the BCEG S program for insurance rating  
Administered by the International Organization for Standard ization ( ISO), the Building Code Effectiveness 
Grading Schedule (BCEGS) assesses the building codes in effect in a particular community and how the 
community enforces its building codes , with special emphasis on mitigation of losses from natural hazards. 
BCEGS develops a relative Building Code Effectiveness Classification for each community for insurance 
rating and underwriting purposes. The concept is simple: municipalities with effective, well -enforced codes 
should demonstrate better loss experience, and insurance rates can reflect that. The prospect of lessening 
catastrophe -related damage and ultimately lowering insurance costs provides an incentive for communities 
to enforce their building codes rigorously —especially as they relate to windstorms and seis mic damage.  
BCEGS encourages the implementation and enforcement of effective building codes, resulting in safer 
buildings, less damage, and communities that suffer less damage when natural disasters occur.  It should 
be noted that the BCEGS is similar in co ncept to ISO’s Public Protection Classification evaluations of 
municipal fire suppression capabilities used by insurers for decades.  Currently, none of the four counties in 
Hawaiʻi  have a BCEGS rating.  
The S tate should first assess  why the BCEGS program is  not being utilized within Hawaiʻi . Once the issues 
for lack of participation have been identified  and addressed , the State should  consider  formally adopt ing 
the BCEGS program as part of its insurance rating program. Additionally, the State should provide technical 
resources to the Counties to support the establishment of a BCEGS classification for each county , and 
commit to providing technical resources to support the maintenance of that classification. Similar to 
Recommended Action 3.3, this recommendatio n is based on the understanding that the full responsibility 
for the commitment to participate and maintain  status  in the BCEGS program lies with each individual Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
234 county and that the State’s role under this recommendation would be to support those efforts w ithin the 
resources and capabilities of the State. 
3.7 Develop pre -disaster recovery frameworks at state and county levels that incorporate 
opportunities to adapt to sea level rise through disaster recovery  
Disasters can provide opportunities to adapt to sea l evel rise. Pre -disaster recovery strategies can support 
managed retreat and other adaptation strategies  by engaging community stakeholders in making decisions 
about land use in the event that a major hazard event, such as a hurricane or tsunami, occurs. Us ing pre -
disaster planning and post -disaster recovery as opportunities for implementation of sea level rise adaptation 
is as advantageous as it is cost effective and reduces repetitive losses. Within these efforts, disaster 
recovery frameworks should be mad e for adaptation strategies than can be individually and voluntarily 
adopted before formal regulations can be put in place . 
3.8 Perform a study to identify what other incentives could be utilized to promote improved flood 
risk management.  
While Recommended Act ions 3.3 and 3.6 have identified incentive -based programs such as the  CRS and 
BCEGS that support enhanced flood risk management, these are not the only options available. A study 
should be commissioned by the State , based on proactive public engagement , that seeks to identify other 
incentives that would drive the private sector to action. The results of this study could inform strategic plans 
that evolve from this Report and set the course for implementation actions.  
Recommendation 4:  Enable legacy beaches  to persist with sea level 
rise  
Overview  
The loss of beaches throughout the Hawaiian archipelago with sea level rise endangers recreational uses, 
cultural practices, critical habitat for wildlife, the economy, and the natural buffering capacity of the sho reline 
from waves. As beaches erode, properties along the shoreline will become increasing vulnerable to coastal 
hazards prompting owners to request emergency waivers for temporary protection which can exacerbate 
erosion along adjacent shorelines. The loss  of beaches also means the loss of wildlife habitat across the 
archipelago, most notably for the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, Hawksbill and green sea turtles, and 
many of our seabirds such as the Laysan albatross and the Newell’s shearwater. Increasing b each loss 
coupled with the continued degradation of coral reef ecosystems from land -based pollution, overfishing, 
and climate change means that coastal environments are in great jeopardy.  
Recommended actions in this section focus on the need to enable bea ches in Hawaiʻi to persist with sea 
level rise and are based around the need for a  state -wide assessment of vulnerable beaches to  identify 
legacy beach conservation priorities  (Figure 138). These priorities should be  identified ba sed on a number 
of social, cultural, economic, and environmental factors , aligned with shoreline protection and preservation 
priorities and  in consultation with communities as part of the community development planning process Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
235 (see Recommendation 1).  Recom mended actions also consider funding for land acquisition and beach 
restoration activities through public -private sector partnerships as well as explore other alternative actions 
to help protect beaches. This may include the realigning of roads and other structures  to eliminate barriers 
that would normally disrupt the natural process of erosion and landward migration of beaches  into sand -
rich coastal plains . In other locations , groins or other beach stabilization structures and sand nourishment 
may be neede d to maintain beaches in front of development . Sand nourishment  may also be needed for 
areas that lack natural sand deposits in the backshore .  
 
Figure 138. Enable legacy beaches to persist with sea level rise  
Recommended Actions  
4.1 Conduct a state -wide  assessment to identify legacy beach conservation priorities  
The DLNR , Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands  (OCCL ), together with federal, state, and county 
government s, nongovernmental organizations, and local stakeholders, should undertake a state -wide 
assessment to prioritize beaches that are important for recreation al uses , cultural practices,  and wildlife  
habitat . As indicated in the results section in Chapter 4, many beaches in the Hawaiian archipelago will 
become very narrow o r completely lost by mid to late century from 3.2 feet of sea level rise. However, 
beaches may be able to thrive, even as sea level rises, if their landward migration  into upland sand deposits 
is not impeded by coastal structures . We may need to identify “ rolling beach easements” and prohibit 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
236 development in such areas, and even consider removing  development from areas with upland sand 
deposits if we hope to retain this vital natural and cultural resource for future generations .  
The State and Counties shoul d also work hand in hand to identify “Legacy Beaches” where special 
adaptation measures , such as preservation of undeveloped lands, managed retreat , and prohibition of 
coastal armoring , should  be implemented in earnest . The tools identified in this Report  are integrated with 
an overall vision of community sustainability, so that  the beaches that are vital to our island cultur e and vital 
to protected  wildlife  species , are protected along with our coastal communities and vital infrastructure.  
4.2 Establish a “wil ling seller” program  to move development away from legacy beaches  
The State should establish a “willing seller” program that pre -identifies property owners that would be willing 
to sell or relocate their property out side of the state -wide vulnerability zon e. As such, l ands acquired through 
the program could be used to establish legacy beaches. There are many successful examples of “willing 
seller ” programs, the most notable of which is the City of Portland, O regon’s  “Johnson Creek Willing Seller 
Program”  which helps move people and property out of areas that frequently flood . Restoration projects on 
land acquired through the program increase flood storage, improve fish and wildlife habitat, restore 
wetlands, and create passive recreational activities for cit y residents. For more information regarding this 
program, please visit https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/106234 . 
4.3 Amend the State Legacy Lands Act to set aside funding for priority coastal lands and enable 
the use of a variety of practices and tools  
The State Legacy Lands Act, passed in 2005, establishe d a permanent fund for land conservation and the 
preservation of open space and scenic resources in Hawaiʻi. Specific projects eligi ble for funding include 
conservation of watersheds, coastal areas, beaches, ocean access, habitat protection, cultural and historic 
sites, natural areas, and open spaces and scenic resources among others. Funding is provided through a 
conveyance tax and 10 % of the program’s annual budget is directed into the State’s Land Conservation 
Fund.  Monies  from the Land Conservation Fund must be used to acquire lands for public purposes, which 
the law defines as preservation of any of the following: watershed protect ion; coastal areas, beaches, and 
ocean access; habitat protection; cultural and historical sites; recreational and public hunting areas; parks; 
natural areas; agricultural production; and open spaces and scenic resources.  The Federal Coastal and 
Estuarine Land Conservation Program can also provide matching funds  to acquire property from willing 
sellers either through fee simple purchase or through conservation easements.  
In addition to land acquisition for legacy beaches, a variety of tools, including buffe r zones  and conservation 
easements, are needed to support conservation of coastal lands through incremental changes in the 
shoreline. Buffer zones could be used to restrict development within specified distances of natural and 
cultural resources. For examp le, Hawai‘i law requires buffer zones to protect artesian water aquifers  and 
archaeological sites.  As another example, Kauaʻi and Maui Counties utilize shoreline construction setbacks 
that are based on historical erosion rates to provide a buffer between chronically retreating shorelines and Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
237 development. Expanding  buffer zones around beaches, sand dunes , and coastal wetlands  would provide 
space for these environments  to migrate landward with rising sea levels.   
Conservation easements seek to “[p]reserve and protect land predominantly in its natural, scenic, forested, 
or open -space condition”  (Codiga and Wager 2011) . Conservation easements are legal agreements 
between landowners and land trusts or government agencies that restrict  development or uses while 
allowing property to remain in private ownership (Codiga and Wager 2011) . In Hawai‘i, conservation 
easements could be created by deed restrictions, covenants, or conditions.  They are freely transferrable, 
perpetual, not personal, may restrict certain types of activity,  and are obtainable by purchase, agreement, 
donation, devise, or bequest, but not by emi nent domain.  State law authorizes public bodies and nonprofit 
organizations  to hold conservation easements for the purpose s of preserving and protecting open space, 
natural landscapes, cultural and historical sites and resources, and agricultural lands.  Traditional 
conservation easements prohibit all development on burdened parcels  but some modern conservation 
easements do not necessarily prohibit but rather limit development to appropriate and desired development . 
4.4 Expand the area of national, state, and co unty parks and wildlife refuges to preserve critical 
coastal wildlife habitats  
The DLNR, working together with federal and county agencies and nongovernmental organizations, should 
identify existing and potential new areas for coastal wildlife refuges thro ughout the State to support both 
new wetlands that may form and wildlife migration from the NWHIs . Hawaii’s endangered wildlife including 
the Hawaiian monk seals, Hawksbill and green sea turtles, and seabirds such as the Laysan albatross and 
Newell’s shear water, depend on a range of low -lying habitats that would be lost as a result of sea level rise 
in the main Hawaiian Islands and the NWHIs . These habitats include beaches and coastal strands, mudflats 
and wetlands, coastal shrub lands and woodlands, and fr eshwater habitats. In anticipation of wildlife climate 
refugees from the NWHIs , we should consider expanding wildlife refuges on the main Hawaiian Islands in 
areas that would provide suitable habitat. The expansion of parks and wildlife refuges and the ide ntification 
of legacy beaches (Recommended Action 4.1) should especially factor in the preservation of critical habitat 
for the highly endangered Hawaiian monk seal  (NOAA Fisheries 2017a)  which includes a landward portion 
that extends 15 feet on land from the shoreline.  
4.5 Prioritize coral reef preservation to buffer the impacts of coastal hazards with sea l evel rise  
Healthy coral reefs and reef flats provide many ecosystem services including sand for beaches and 
protection from wave energy. In addition to local threats to Hawaii’s coral reefs, increasing sea surface 
temperatures that cause coral bleaching an d ocean acidification that weakens coral skeletal structure s and 
calcification , pose new and significant stresses to these vital ecosystems. More than ever, Hawaii’s coral 
reefs need to be protected and restored to support multiple ecosystems services. In September 2016, 
Governor Ige made a World Conservation Congress Legacy Commitment to have 30% of Hawaii’s 
nearshore waters effectively managed by 2030. This commitment needs to be backed with greater human 
and financial resources.  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
238 4.6 Develop public -private pa rtnerships for coastal land acquisition, beach management, and reef 
protection  
Public -private partnerships can be an effective conservation tool. State and counties, together with private 
land owners, should explore opportunities to preserve coastal resou rces along the shoreline. The State’s 
Natural Area Reserve System is a model for public -private partnerships for natural resource conservation 
that could be expanded to cover more shoreline areas.  In addition, a number of private and 
nongovernmental organi zations in Hawaiʻi are dedicated to preserving and acquiring land to be held for 
public access and coastal resource conservation. Organizations such as, The Nature Conservancy, The 
Hawaiʻi Trust for Public Land, and the Hawaiian Islands Land Trust, use a v ariety of tools to acquire and 
protect valued lands.  
Recommendation 5:  Preserve Native Hawaiian culture and 
communities  with sea level rise  
Overview  
Many Native Hawaiian cultural resources, practices, and communities that are located along and depend 
on access to the coast would be impacted by chronic flooding with sea level rise. Native Hawaiian cultural 
heritage is central to identify ing a sense of place  as the capacity of cultural resources to move or change  is 
limited due to their strong ties to place.   
Recommended actions in th is section are proposed to help preserve Native Hawaiian culture and 
communities with sea level rise ( Figure 139). First, an archipelagic inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural 
resources and practices pot entially impacted by sea level rise is needed to understand the full extent of the 
impacts. A culturally informed process and protocols are needed to make decisions about cultural resources 
threatened by rising seas. An adaptation planning process is also needed to ensure that coastal land and 
access to the sea is preserved for Native Hawaiian communities as the sea level rises.  
It is important to note that unlike historic sites which have identifiable boundaries, locations where Hawaiian 
customs and practi ces have traditionally occurred are much harder to document because many of these 
heritage resources are intangible. Yet, this indigenous and local knowledge is an invaluable asset, and in 
many ways, the most vulnerable. Some of this information may be ava ilable through existing resources, yet 
there is unlikely to be a single aggregated database. In many cases, kua‘āina (people of the land), 
particularly practitioners such as fishermen, are resistant to identify locations where resources are still 
abundant.  With careful consideration of sensitive data that should not be made public, an inventory of 
locations where traditional and customary practices occur should be developed.  
 
 
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
239  
Figure 139. Preserve Native Hawaiian culture and comm unities with sea level rise  
Recommended Actions  
5.1 Develop an archipelagic -wide inventory of Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices 
impacted by sea level rise  
In addition to updating the state -wide survey and inventory developed by the State of Hawa i‘i Historic 
Preservation Division (SHPD) (prepared pursuant to HRS §6E -3), which identifies and documents historic 
properties, aviation artifacts, and burial sites, an inventory of traditional and customary Native Hawaiian 
cultural resources and practices  impacted by sea level rise should also be developed building on the results 
of this Report and other studies (Marrack and O'Grady 2014, Wagner and Polhemus 2016, Kane et al. 
2012, University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Working together with SHPD, the State of Hawaiʻi Office of Hawaiian 
Affairs (OHA ), the B urial Councils, and t he ‘Aha Moku Councils, the use of the two inventories should 
identify priorities to relocate  or reinforce Native Hawa iian cultural resources.  
 
 
 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
240 5.2 Work with Native Hawaiian Communities to d evelop a culturally -based adaptation process 
and protocols to preserve iwi kūpuna and Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices 
with sea level rise  
A culturally based adaptation process , as well as protocols , should be developed to address impacts of sea 
level rise on Native Hawaiian cultural resources and practices (University of Hawaiʻi 2015) . Integral to this 
strategy would be: (1) ranking the vulnerability of threatened cultural features based upon significance and 
the timing of sea level rise impacts, (2) developing protocols to appropriately manage the assets, such as 
possible relocation and  preservation of cultural features, and (3) developing a mitigation strategy with lineal 
and/or cultural descendants of the iwi kūpuna  (Kane et al. 2012) . This effort  would likely  require a concert 
of agencies including SHP D, OHA,  the Burial Councils , the ‘Aha Moku  Councils, the NWHIs  Native 
Hawaiian Cultural Working Group, and other Native Hawaiian organizations across the State.  It would  
require a state -wide framework that would  need to be tailored to each island  that would  start with 
conversations with families and groups on each moku to ask how they would like to plan for their resources 
(e.g., relocat ion or  reinforce ment ). This conversation w ould be different for each community and each 
resource, for example, a loko i ‘a might ha ve a different overseeing group than  a heiau.  
Projects like Loli Aniau, Maka‘ala Aniau, (Climate Change, Climate Alert) or “LAMA” have long been 
sounding the alarm on climate impacts in Hawai‘i and across the Pacific. As such, Hawaiian communities 
have alr eady begun building their capacity to address and respond to climate threats. In some cases, 
protocols already exist, like in the case of iwi kūpuna, well -established protocols under HRS Chapter 6E 
and the applicable administrative rules specify the proces s. To some degree, there are numerous state and 
federal laws that provide helpful guidance on how to address sea level rise impacts on historic properties, 
however, the guidance was not intended for sea level rise (see https://www.nps.gov/tPS/how -
topreserve/preservedocs/Moving -Historic -Buildings.pdf ). Nonetheless, historic preservation guidance does 
exist on the relocation of historic properties that could be repurposed for addressing sea level rise. In other 
cases, thorough documentation of sites may be the only solution, which could be accomplished through 
Recommended Action 5.1.  
The reality is that like many other resources, and due to the uncertainty of th e timing and extent of sea level 
rise, the cultural response to sea level rise is going to be largely case -by-case, or at best, at a community 
level. As with all other resources and assets at risk, responses to sea level rise are largely dependent on 
the financial resources available, therefore it would  be essential to manage the expectations of communities 
as to what can realistically be saved . This is why it is important to recognize the validity  of the SLR-XA as 
a vulnerability zone  so that communities c an appropriately document  cultural resources that could be lost  
in the future . 
5.3 Develop adaptation plans to preserve access to coastal lands and water within Native 
Hawaiian communities with sea level rise  
Agencies such as the Department of Hawaiian Homelan ds (DHHL), OHA, and t he ‘Aha Moku Councils 
should work with Native Hawaiian communities to develop adaptation plans to preserve access to coastal Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
241 lands and water impacted by sea level rise. A combination of adaptation strategies may be required to 
preserve  access.  These adaptation plans should build on the vulnerability assessment results of this 
Report.  
Recommendation 6:  Protect nearshore water quality from  sea level 
rise impacts  
Overview  
Underground storage tanks (USTs), OSDS, including septic systems, c esspools, and wastewater treatment 
plants, and hazardous materials/waste storage facilities currently pose risks to aquifers, nearshore  water 
quality, and coral reef  ecosystems. These risks would  increase with sea level rise.  USTs not designed to 
withstand  corrosive seawater may have increased failures. OSDS in coastal areas would also be vulnerable 
to flooding  from the ocean  as well as from rising groundwater table s. Increased flooding and coastal erosion 
with sea level rise would increase pollutant runoff , and could provide new sources of contaminant pathways 
from existing  wastewater facilities and  hazardous waste sites or storage facilities not designed to withstand 
constant flood conditions.  
The Recommended Actions proposed in this section could be taken  over the short -term as well as changes 
in laws and regulations over the long -term to protect nearshore water quality with sea level rise. S trategies 
and recommendations for adapting to sea level rise would include a mixture of: (1) reviewing existing laws , 
regulations, and best management practices  (BMP s), (2) crafting and implementing new laws, regulations, 
and BMPs , and (3) evaluating current conditions to prioritize near -term actions ( Figure 140).  
The State of Hawai‘i, Departm ent of Health  maintains policies, guidelines, and procedures for the 
construction, maintenance, and mitigation of USTs , OSDS  or wastewater treatment, and hazardous 
materials/waste storage facilities. Inherently, each of these systems pose current and futur e risks to our 
aquifers, nearshore  water quality, and marine ecosystems. Maintaining oversight of these systems is 
already a very challenging task for the impleme nting agencies —and the multiple effects of sea level rise 
would  greatly increase the complexit y of planning, permitting, and mitigating possible breaches or leaks to 
these systems. The possible effects of sea level rise include : 
 The boundary of salt water intrusion moving more landward (where  fresh groundwater flows from 
inland areas meets with the  saline groundwater from the ocean) , resulting in new saline, corrosive 
conditions ; 
 The boundary of salt water intrusion  found at higher elevations, resulting in subsurface soil 
inundation that did not exist previously ;  
 The higher elevation of salt water intrusion causing  groundwater to elevate higher than previously, 
also resulting in subsurface soil inundation that did not exist previously ; 
 Increased rainfall associated with climate change could also contribute to increased upland 
groundwater recharge, a nd therefore also increase groundwater levels beyond those associated 
with sea level rise ; and  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
242  In fairly low coastal areas where saline  water or  fresh  groundwater levels rise above current land 
elevations, these areas would  become flooded, introducing a ne w threat to water quality through 
interaction with surface soil hazards or contamination.  
 
Figure 140. Protect nearshore water quality from sea level rise impacts  
USTs  may not be designed to withstand elevated water levels  and the refore would be compromised. For 
OSDS/ wastewater systems, the higher water table reduces the distance from the ground surface to the 
leach  field, compromising their effectiveness to treat bacteria and pathogens . In addition, the ripple effect 
of the failur e of one system would  exacerbate possible weaknesses of other systems, causing additional 
concerns and challenges for the implementing agencies. Risks of failures to all of these systems would  
increase with sea level rise. Because sea level rise would  only compound these issues in the future, 
agencies could address these gaps in the management structure  sooner than later .  
Recommended Actions  
6.1 Identify hazard mitigation measures to address coastal flooding of hazardous material/waste 
storage facilities, unde rground storage tanks, and on -site sewage disposal systems 
vulnerable to sea level rise  
Based on existing permits, site records, and agency files, conduct a thorough review of UST, OSDS, and 
hazardous material/waste storage facilities within the SLR -XA as a vulnerability zone  (see Recommend ed 
Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
243 Action  1.1). The objective of the review would be to identify sites or geographic areas with the highest 
probability of large or catastrophic failures or releases associated with increased coastal flooding with sea 
level rise. Once a priority list has been prepared, develop hazard mitigation measures that landowners, 
permittees, and operators of these facilities can implement to address these threats. Technical support is 
needed to provide standards and BMPs for water p roofing, improved flood control, and possibly re -siting 
options. Educational  and outreach  efforts should  strive to increase awareness of potential impacts from 
increased flooding and/or sea water intrusion and provid e public forums to discuss near -term act ions and 
long-term mitigation measures.  
Examples of actions similar to the one proposed can be found in California, where San Mateo County 
inventoried hazardous waste sites that may be affected by sea level rise within their vulnerability 
assessment with emphasis on those near beneficial groundwater uses. In Delaware, a vulnerability study 
assessed hazardous waste storage facilities within the path of rising sea levels and identified those which 
should initiate plans to prevent releases. Further abroad, th e Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands ’ Bureau of Environmental and Coastal Quality has updated their above ground storage tank website 
to direct permit holders to review the “Saipan Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment: Saipan Sea Level 
Rise In undation” as a guide when siting new above ground storage tanks.  
6.2 Review existing environmental regulations, guidance documents, and best management 
practices  
The State of Hawai‘i Department of Health maintains policies, guidelines, and procedures for the 
construction, maintenance, and mitigation of USTs, OSDS or wastewater treatment, and hazardous 
mate rials/waste storage facilities. Recognizing that sea level rise would result in inundation of USTs, Act 
179 was passed in 2016, prohibiting the issues of per mits for new USTs within 100 yards of the shoreline 
and other provisions. A comprehensive review and gap analysis of current Hawaiʻi  laws and guidance 
pertaining to USTs, OSDS, and hazardous waste sites and facilities is needed to identify potential areas 
for revision. This review should focus on existing regulations that allow for siting new facilities in flood 
hazard prone areas as well as monitoring or enforcement of existing vulnerable systems and facilities. This 
review should highlight priority action s, which could  be implemented immediately by each agency to protect 
against failures of vulnerable systems. The gap analysis would identify recommendations for changes and 
improvements to current regulations and guidance for future updates. A successful ex ample of this is the 
State of New Jersey’s  Climate Adaptation Alliance , which  conducted a gap analysis in 2013 to summarize 
opportunities for improvement in order to inform climate change policy recommendations  (New Jersey 
Climat e Adaptation Alliance (NJCAA) 2013) . 
6.3 Update guidance and propose legislative amendments to existing environmental regulations  
Based on the gap analysis conducted under Recommend Action 6.2, updates to existing guidance could 
be made and legislative change s proposed that could require additional measures to protect against 
vulnerable wastewater and hazardous waste systems and increased failures. For example, the s iting and 
design or reengineering of these facilities should take into account the potential im pacts of sea level rise , Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
244 or permits for new USTs or OSDS should be prohibited in the state -wide vulnerability zone (see 
Recommended Action 1.1) . New guidance could include the preparation of hazard mitigation plans to 
prevent leaks from existing facilities  or increased performance standards to protect against new threats 
associated with increased and constant flood conditions. Recommended changes could include increased 
monitoring and enforcement of land -based pollutant runoff from shorelines exposed to sea  level rise. 
Specifically, HRS §340D -50.5 (Act 248, 2016) , which prohibits the discharge of treated or raw sewage into 
state waters after December 31, 2026, could be amended to take into account impacts from sea level rise 
and be used as a measure to assis t in the “enforcement of land -based pollutant runoff.”  
Recommendation 7:  Develop innovative  and sustainable financing 
and incentives to support  adaptation to sea level rise   
Overview  
One of the many challenges of adapting to sea level rise is determining  how to pay for adaptation initiatives 
such as retrofitting or relocating critical infrastructure, buy -out programs for highly vulnerable communities, 
and land acquisitions to enable Hawaii’s beaches to persist. A combination of financing and incentive 
programs are needed to support the planning and implementation of long -term adaptation strategies.  
Recommended actions in this section are proposed to support innovative and sustainable financing and 
incentives needed to address the complexities of adapting to sea level rise. More comprehensive f inancial 
and economic analys es of the impacts of sea level rise  are needed to quantify the loss to tax revenues and 
the economy from sea level rise. The potential economic impacts assessed in this Report are limited t o 
primarily the loss of structures and land. Additional analyses would provide a greater understanding of what 
would be lost as well as the cost of adaptation. A multi -pronged financing strategy drawn through 
partnerships with p ublic, priv ate, and philanth ropic entities needs to be developed building on lessons from 
the latest innovations and identified best practices. Economic incentives to avoid risks from sea level rise 
such as through TDRs, purchase of development r ights (PDR), and buy -out programs , combined with 
mandatory real estate disclosures of sea level rise risks , are needed to support a comprehensive approach 
to addressing the cost of adaptation.  
Recommended Actions  
7.1 Conduct  more detailed financial and economic analysis of sea level rise impacts in the SLR -
XA  
The estimated  economic impacts  to the State  assessed in this Report are limited to the loss of structures 
and land . Based on the modeling in the results chapter , the State should conduct a more detailed impact 
analysis to  understand the full  economic  impact to the  State and  Counties of both reducing or mitigati ng 
the impacts of sea level  rise compared to not  doing anything  (i.e. benefit -cost analysis) . This information 
would  inform State and County officials and citizens of the full economic  impact of sea level  rise as it 
specifically relates to each County . Based on higher resolution economic impact assessments, agencies 
could then have a more realistic or purposeful discussion regarding financial burdens, liabilities, and future Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
245 opportunitie s presented as a result of sea level rise. For commercial and industrial uses, impacts that would  
need to be consider ed include  job loss, secondary and tertiary business impacts , and impacts to the tourism 
industry state -wide. For private propert ies impact ed by sea level rise, the impact would be tremendous for 
families and well as county tax coffers.  
7.2 Develop a multi -pronged financing strategy at federal, state, county,  private sector,  and 
philanthropic levels to address costs of adaptation to sea level ris e 
A multi -pronged funding strategy should be developed at federal, state, county, private sector and 
philanthropic levels to secure significant and sustainable funding for investments that reduce risks, harm to 
people, and disaster spending from coastal ha zards with sea level rise. Based on prioritized projects, the 
funding strategy would  identify applicable sources, eligibility criteria, application processes, outreach 
strategies, and detailed implementation steps to achieve a defined set of funding goals.   
Some of the costs anticipated as a result of sea level rise include : (1) land acquisition, (2) relocation or 
retrofitting of critical infrastructure (such as roads, airports, harbors, and power, water, and wastewater 
facilities and distribution lines), (3) relocation of residential areas  and retrofitting to increase flood resiliency , 
and (4) land acquisition for wetland and beach migration and public access.  
As part of this strategy, the Hawai‘i Legislature could adopt laws enabling state and local gover nments to 
develop tax incentive programs and special tax districts. Incentives could be used to encourage landward 
relocation, retrofitting to increase flood resiliency, siting of new development in upland areas, conservation 
of open space along the shorel ine, and preservation or restoration of natural flood buffers. Although tax 
incentives may lack support in times of budget shortfalls, they are a proven policy tool to achieve key social, 
economic, and environmental objectives. Creating financial incentive  programs for sea level rise and other 
climate change impacts, however, would  require decision -makers to establish clear priorities regarding the 
type of development (e.g., new or existing, critical infrastructure, and residential development) to be 
encour aged or discouraged in particular areas.  
The private sector also could  be employed through either voluntary contribution of funding, or compensatory 
payment of assessments such as impact fees, sustainability fees on permit applications for new 
development,  or other assessment s on real property . These mechanisms could  be enacted locally, or 
authorized at the State level and adopted at local discretion.  
Finally, philanthropic interests such as the Rockefeller  and MacArthur Foundations could be approached 
to gain their support address Hawai‘i’s acute and imminent challenge of sea level rise, an idea likely to be 
of great interest to these foundations given their significant financial contributions to resilience. The City 
and County of Honolulu has already take n advantage of this support by being chosen to participate as one 
of the Rockefeller  Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities (100RC). 100RC supports the adoption and 
incorporation of a view of resilience that includes not just “shocks” (i.e. earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.), but 
also the stresses that weaken the fabric of a city on a day to day or cyclical basis. Cities in the 100RC Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
246 network are provided with resources necessary to develop a “roadmap” to resilience along four main 
pathways:  
1. Financial and logi stical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a 
Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city’s resilience efforts ;  
2. Expert support for development of a robust Resilience Strategy ;  
3. Access to solutions, service provider s, and partners f rom the private, public and non -governmental 
organization sectors who can help them develop and implement their Resilience Strategies ; and  
4. Membership of a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other.  
In addition , Hawai‘i may wish to form its own nonprofit foundation to raise funds for project that protect 
vulnerable populations such as those who are  economically disadvantaged, seniors, disabled persons, and 
veterans.  
A growing number of different financing and in centive strategies are beginning to emerge to support 
adaptation to sea level rise. A number of best practices for financing adaptation to sea level rise were 
identified for the San Francisco Bay Area such as enterprise revenue bonds, sales tax, and genera l 
obligation funding (Urban Land Institute 2015) . In New Jersey, a state -wide buy -out program for Blue Acres 
was created af ter Hurricane Sandy  (State of New Jersey 2017b) . The Blue Acres program was funded with 
a combination of federal, state and local grants and established a protocol for purchasing homes from 
willing sellers in communities subject to repeated flooding. Once the proper ty was purchased, the structures 
were demolished and the property was designated as open space. The main focus of this program were 
properties (including structures) that have been damaged by, or may be prone to incurring damage caused 
by storms or storm -related flooding, or that may buffer or protect other lands from such damage. Cost-
benefit analyses of strategy combinations would be essential to support community -level adaptation 
planning. As such, a multi -pronged, multi -stakeholder, and phased funding s trategy would be required that 
takes into account the complexity of issues surrounding adaptation to sea level rise.   
7.3 Require mandatory disclosure for private properties  and public offerings located in areas with 
potential exposure t o sea level rise  
The State should  work with the real estate and insurance industries to  require mandatory disclosures  of 
risks for all properties located within the SLR -XA. The list of disclosable hazards should be expanded for 
public offerings to include  future  risks of sea lev el rise , including erosion and flooding,  and other risks from 
climate change.  
7.4 Explore the use of transfer of development rights and purchase of development rights 
programs that facilitate managed retreat and legacy beach preservation  
All counties should c onsider adopting ordinances for TDR /PDR  programs that facilitate sea level rise 
adaptation. Implementation would require counties to:  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
247  Designate sending areas (e.g., areas vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal hazards, areas 
serving as natural flood buff ers, or areas that have experienced repeated or heavy storm 
damage);  
 Designate receiving areas (e.g., areas located upland or inland that are less vulnerable for 
development);  
 Calibrate credit values by balancing the market value of lots in receiving areas  with the market 
value of lots in sending areas;  
 Develop a pool of development rights that are legally severable from the land; and  
 Establish a procedure for transferring rights from one party to another (either through private 
transactions or a publicly owned and operated TDR bank) (Codiga and Wager 2011, Christ Hart 
& Partners 2007) . 
Legacy beach conservation progr am funding (Recommended Action 4.3) could be used to cover the cost 
of these TDRs and PDRs and related coastal land acquisition programs for legacy beach priority areas. 
Other potential sources of revenue for this fund might include a portion of the Transi ent Accommodations 
Tax),  green bonds, gasoline  tax, property t ax, tax credits, short -term vacation rental  tax, or penalties for 
unauthorized or unpermitted land uses. The Waikīkī Beach Special Improvement District Fund is one 
example where all commercial properties in Waikīkī pay into a special beach fund for Waikīkī , which is  
based on the assessed value for property taxes.  
The State should also develop and offer a grant program to the Counties for the development of ordinances 
creating TDR and PDR programs related to sea level rise. This would allow the Counties to access experts 
in the field of municipal law and TDRs and PDRs to develop these ordinances.  
7.5 Consider the feasibility of a buy -out program for residential property owners vulnerable to 
sea level rise  
Managed retreat has long been avoided in public dialogue as an adaptation strategy. Yet when weighed 
against the magnitude of risk faced by coastal and  riverine communities, retreat should be included in the 
toolbox of strategies for climate adaptation. While there do not appear to be any existing residential land 
acquisition programs for sea level rise vulnerability, there are corollary programs at the federal level that 
could provide us with lessons and tools.  
The Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program (FMA) provides funding to States and local communities 
for projects and planning that reduces or eliminates long -term risk of flood damage to structur es insured 
under the NFIP.  FMA funding is also available for managing costs. Under the FMA, FEMA allows for up to 
100% of the costs to be covered for Severe Repetitive Loss properties unlike for Repetitive Loss properties 
in which FEMA usually only covers  90% of the cost. Severe Repetitive Loss properties consists of any 
NFIP -insured residential property that has met as least one of the following paid flood loss criteria since 
1978, regardless of ownership:  Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
248  4 or more separate claim payments of more than $5 ,000 each (including building and contents 
payments); or  
 2 or more separate claim payments (building payments only) where the total of the payment 
exceeds the current value of the property.   
Repetitive Loss properties consist of NFIP -insured residential properties that have had one or more claim 
payment(s) for flood damages.  
The State could develop a policy for prioritizing areas for acquisition within the State -wide vulnerability zone 
and model it after the FMA program. However, timing of such a program  presents new challenges since a 
goal would be to preemptively move development from areas of increasing flooding and erosion risk before 
catastrophic losses occur, rather than compensating people after a disaster event. Nevertheless, a buy -out 
program for  at-risk coastal properties needs serious discussion, given our expanded understanding of 
present and future risks of erosion and flooding risks through this Report and other data tools referenced 
herein.  
As a normal course of action each year, the State s hould  also focus its efforts on developing applications 
to both of FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program ( PDM ) and the FMA Grant P rogram. PDM 
provides funds for hazard mitigation planning and projects . This funding is available on an annual basis an d 
is awarded on a competitive basis . The goal of this program is to reduce overall risk to the residents, 
structures and facilities from future hazard events, which includes flooding before a flooding disaster.  
Post -Flooding Disaster Policy . After a flood ing disaster, a state may be provided funding opportunities 
from several sources that could also support buy -outs of impacted residential properties that are located in 
the SLR -XA. The State, Counties, and local communities should prioritize investments in  qualified 
properties and facilities as a way to remove them from the areas of inundation and return the existing land 
to its pre -development condition  and prevent future development. Where possible, government and 
communities  should also focus post-disast er recovery funds  on rebuilding infrastructure in areas that are 
out of the areas of present day flood zones and the SLR -XA. If the infrastructure cannot be removed, then 
efforts should be focused on making them more resilient to sea level  rise and floodin g through the recovery 
process . 
One example of potential funding would be through the HMGP  that is provided after a presidentially 
declared disaster. According to FEMA: “the purpose of the HMGP  is to help communities implement hazard 
mitigation measures fo llowing a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration in the areas of the state, tribe, or 
territory requested by the Governor or Tribal Executive. The key purpose of this grant program is to enact 
mitigation measures that reduce the risk of loss of life and p roperty from future disasters.” A second potential 
funding source would be the CDBG -DR program. When appropriated by the U .S. Congress, these funds 
may be used in eligible areas of the community for un -met needs focused on residential housing buy-outs, 
elevations and rehabilitation projects/programs. The funds may also be used for infrastructure and 
economic development. All three major uses of these funds can focus not only on recovery from a disaster, Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
249 including flooding, but also resilience. Making the co mmunity more resilient through eligible 
projects/programs is one of the targets of this funding.  
State -wide  Buy-out Program. Buy-out programs could be designed and implemented to yield successful 
outcomes for residents and government entities alike (Freudenberg et al. 2016) . Although buy -out programs 
have not been established for sea level rise vulnerability, buy -out programs have been employed in New 
York, New Jersey, and Connecticut f ollowing Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Of the billions of federal aid 
spent on resilience and recovery in the New York metropolitan region, at least $750 million was spent on 
buy-outs, which alleviated the flood risk for more than 1,500 homes.  Lessons learne d based on case studies 
conducted within the New York metropolitan region detail key areas for improvement which include:  
 Rethinking the purpose and timeline of buy -out programs;  
 Improv ing the administration of funding for buy-out programs;  
 Consider ing alternative funding models for  buy-out programs ; 
 Improving  planning processes to anticipate and  integrate buy-out programs ; 
 Making participation in buy-outs easier and more  attractive for municipalities ; and  
 Streamlining buy -outs to facilitate participation (Freudenberg et al. 2016).  
Recommendation 8:  Support research, assessment, and monitoring 
to support adaptation to sea level rise  
Overview  
As science continues to advance, new projections and modeling will be available to update the vulnerability 
assessme nt. Scientific and community -based monitoring would be needed to validate changing conditions 
over time. Other types of research and assessment, including cost -benefit analyses and more detailed 
economic studies are needed to support the evaluation of adap tation strategies at community, county, and 
state levels. Research, assessment and monitoring are essential in supporting flexible, anticipatory, and 
phased, approaches to sea level rise adaptation based on the latest and best science.  The State has 
premie r research institutions to develop and implement a robust and relevant science agenda to support 
understanding of and adaption to climate change and sea level rise.   
Recommended Actions in this section highlight the vital role that supporting ongoing resea rch, assessment, 
and monitoring plays as part of an overall adaptation strategy. At the heart of the 5 -year update of th is 
Report, as mandated by Act 32, is determining the need to update the coastal hazards modeling and 
vulnerability assessment based on n ew global projections of sea level rise and new methods. There is also 
an important role of citizen science in monitoring the impacts of sea level rise.  
 Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
250 Recommended Actions  
8.1 Update coastal hazards modeling and vulnerability assessment as needed based on n ew 
climate science, sea lev el rise projections, and methods  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission should establish a maintenance schedule to review the SLR -XA as a 
state -wide vulnerability zone  for planning, policies, and regulations and to determine if updates are 
warranted. The need for updating coastal hazards modeling sho uld be determined based on the extent to 
which new modeling would substantially change exposure and vulnerability in the SLR -XA. Small, pilot 
modeling efforts should be conducted  in selected areas with high vulnerability to sea level rise to evaluate 
the d egree to which any new modeling would substantially change the hazard overlays or contributes to 
more robust design standards based on SLR -XA (see Recommended Actions 1.1, 2.6, 3.1, and 3.2 ). As a 
priority, additional d ata collect ion and modeling should in clude coastal erosion  and annual high wave 
flooding for the islands of Moloka ‘i, Lāna‘i  and Hawai ‘i. Further, a  comprehensive review of models should 
be conducted to determine if a new approach is needed to model coastal hazards with sea level rise. If new  
modeling is warranted, the updated results should be integrated in state, county, and community plans and 
which could serve as a basis for floodplain regulations.  
8.2 Engage communities in monitoring the impacts of sea level rise  
Community engagement would b ecome increasingly important to validate changing conditions over time. 
The following offers ideas for community engagement strategies to keep residents informed, educated and 
involved in monitoring the impacts of sea level rise.  
• Update the Hawai ‘i SLR Vie wer with new sea level rise modeling results . 
• Use community -based planning to educate communities on their risk to sea level rise . 
• Develop a phone app lication  to visualize sea level rise  based on geolocation and projections . 
• Collect historic photographs or  photo graphs  of landmarks and utilize the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise 
Viewer to develop photo simulations on how future flooding might look . 
• Work with science centers to educate communities about sea level rise and its impacts . 
• Leverage the State and County hazard mitigation plan  stakeholder and ou treach strategies to 
include sea level rise . 
• Develop an online web map to allow residents to capture changes over time (e.g. , photographs, 
spatial extent, and textual observations) . 
The University of Hawaiʻi Sea Grant Center for Coastal and Climate Science  and Resilience  has already 
initiated a successful citizen science program for documenting tidal flooding (see description in Sea Level 
Rise Outlook chapter of this Report). The  King Tide Project engaged citizen scientists in documenting tidal 
flooding  in May, June, and July 2017 , contributing more than  2,400  photo records (University of Hawaiʻi 
Sea Grant College Program 2016) . Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
251 8.3 Conduct in -depth  assessment of vulnerability and evaluation of adaptation strategies  for 
critical infrastructure  throughout the State  
The State  and Counties should conduct an in -depth risk and vulnerability assessment to determine critical 
infrastructure at risk to sea level rise throughout the State as part of the hazard mitigation planning and risk 
assessment process. The vulnerability assessme nt results in this Report could be used as one component 
of a prioritization methodology to rank the infrastructure to help determine the order of investment to protect, 
retrofit, or relocate. This effort should be coordinated with efforts to prioritize sh oreline protection and 
preservation (see Recommended Action 1.6). Additional elements to include in the ranking would  include 
current condition, years of useful life left, and other cost -benefit components. A prioritized action plan should 
be developed to identify the most at -risk infrastructure and then associated adaptation options and funding 
sources for implementation. The analysis and future updates could be conducted concurrent ly with the 
State and County hazard mitigation plan updates to ensure resul ts are linked to the updated mitigation 
strategies and associated prioritization.  
8.4 Develop a sea level rise research, assessment, and monitoring agenda to support the 5 -year 
update process  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission should convene a multisectoral expert s group to identify research, 
assessment, and monitoring priorities to support the 5 -year update process. These priorities should be 
informed by the learning questions presented in this Report and reviewed and refined over time. This 
agenda of research, as sessment, and monitoring priorities should endeavor to use scientific findings as 
well as traditional and local knowledge. The development of this agenda should be integrated with the 
monitoring and evaluation plan developed for the 5 -year update (see Reco mmended Action 9.5).  
Recommendation 9:  Promote collaboration and accountability for  
adapting to sea level rise  
Overview  
Adapting to sea level rise will require difficult decisions on when, how, and where to adapt. These decisions 
would  need to be coordin ated among different agencies and sectors , and reviewed and updated  as 
conditions change. Collaboration among federal, state,  and county  agencies is essential to ensure that 
plans and programs are regularly reviewed and aligned to support effective and eff icient adaptation as well 
as avoid maladaptation . Adaptation efforts would need to cross -jurisdictional boundaries, consider the 
natural boundaries, and  address multiple scales of planning (Urban Land Institute 2015) . Establishing 
collaborative processes through which public and  private stakeholders can work together  would  be critical 
to Hawaii ’s efforts to address the impacts  of sea level rise, while meeting other state goals and objectives.  
Recommended actions in this section emphasize the need to promote collaboration and accountability for 
sea level rise adaptation.  The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission should serve as a forum for interagency 
collaboration and accountability for sea level rise adaptation. The Commission should consider new actions 
to take such as prioritizing areas for managed retreat, developing a science agenda, and promoting the Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
252 recommendations put forward in this Report. Further, t he continued support to agencies such as the OCCL, 
Office of Planning /CZM and the Counties is essential in providing coordination and technical support to the 
Commission and st rategic partnerships among government, nongovernment, and private stakeholders and 
the public. In addition, strategic partnerships with a range of stakeholder groups should  be formed to guide 
and support the work of the Commission. A comprehensive educatio n and outreach program would build 
an informed constituency encompassing all sectors and all ages. Monitoring and evaluation  is essential for 
accounting for progress or making course corrections to address Hawaii’s vulnerability to sea level rise.  
Recommen ded Actions  
9.1 Develop sea level rise adaption priorities for the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission should develop priorities that move the ideas and recommendations 
within this Report to actions. Should  the Hawaiʻi  Climate Commission decides to embark on a 
comprehensive strategic plan for  climate change mitigation and adaptation, sea level rise should be a major 
component of that effort. Once developed, the  sea level rise adaption  priorities could be presented to the 
Governor, the County mayors, and the public . In addition, t he Hawaiʻi Climate Commission could also 
oversee how the priorities are being implemented through annual reports or updates from the Commission 
staff.  
The recommendations of this Report could  be further developed and incorporated as initiatives into 
adaptation  plans, wo rking hand and hand with all stakeholders. Lead agencies, timelines, funding sources , 
and performance metrics could  be developed for  such plans. In addition, the Commission should id entify 
and secure funding sources for initiatives ; assess current legislat ion that may promote maladaptation or 
hinder proactive adaptation efforts ; develop a system by which to review newly proposed legislation for 
such concerns ; and develop a public engagement strategy to provide coordinated, clear and concise 
messaging on cli mate change impacts.  To support the multiple work streams of the Hawaiʻi  Climate 
Commission, working groups could be formed to provide technical input and feedback. As an example, 
initial work groups for the Commission could include the following:  
 Education and Outreach Worki ng Group  
 Adaptation and Response Working Group  
 Climate Mitigation Working Group  
 Scientific and Technical Working Group  
 Legislative Review Working Group  
There are several examples of proactive planning  and collaboration  to support the development of an 
approach to mitigat e the impacts of sea level rise. The California Coastal Commission has a regularly 
updated s trategic plan that includes a goal to address climate change through local coastal program 
planning, coastal permitting, interagency collaboration an d public education . The California Coastal 
Commission  has also developed guidance on sea level rise adaptation for local government and residents 
(California Coastal Commission 2013, 2017, 2015) . The Washington DC Silver Jackets team formalized in Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
253 2014  (Washin gton 2017) , is an interagency working group comp osed of more than 25 federal, district, 
regional, and academic partners working to collaboratively address flood risk in the area. The team has 
established five task groups: Development of Flood Inundation M apping/Stream Gauges; Flood Emergency 
Planning; Interior Drainage Flooding; Levee Certification and Accreditation; and Flood Risk 
Communication. Each task group has responsibilities that aid in fulfilling the team’s overall mission and 
goals. The risk comm unication group has developed an internal and external communication guide to 
ensure consistent and clear messaging to the public, as well as standards for communicating between 
agencies that are a part of the team.   
9.2 Continue to support  the Office of Plann ing and DLNR , OCCL to provide leadership, technical 
support, education and outreach, and interagency coordination to the Hawaiʻi Climate 
Commission and other stakeholders for sea level rise  
Together, the OCCL, CZM, and the county planning departments, are responsible fo r regulating 
development and managing resources along a changing shoreline. These offices already face substantial 
challenges in their permitting and planning processes due to the predominant trend of coastal erosion and 
ever-growing pressure to develop an d protect private shorefront lands and infrastructure. The burden on 
these offices will continue to grow in coming years as flooding and erosion impacts become more severe 
and frequent with increasing sea level rise. O nce the Report is released, the OCCL, CZM, and the county 
planning departments should continue to provide leadership and coordination among  government  
agencies , nongovernment  organizations , private sector  stakeholders , and communities  in understand ing 
the conseque nces of sea level rise and  applying this knowledge to their decision -making. Partnerships with 
the University of Hawaiʻi Sea Grant College Program and others should be leveraged to provide support. 
At the direction of the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission, the  OCCL, CZM, and the county planning departments  
should be responsible for implem enting many of actions based on the Report ’s Recommendations.  
9.3 Develop a multi -agency , multi -media , and multi -stakeholder  education and outreach program 
as part of a long -term commitment to building an informed and active constituency on climate 
change miti gation and adaptation  
A comprehensive education and outreach program should be developed and maintained informed by the 
latest research in social science and guidance on climate change communication (FEMA 2013, Cent er for 
Research on Environmental Decisions and ecoAmerica 2014, Center for Research on Environmental 
Decisions 2009) . Consistency in messaging is critical. A program for public information built off the best 
practices established by the NFIP CRS should be  developed . This program should  identify appropriate 
messages for various target audiences; projects, programs, and other community efforts that should convey 
these messages; materials to be used to support the identified messages; and ways to determine th e 
success of identified outreach.  
Outreach materials and messages w ould require an adaptive approach as sea level rise science changes 
and lessons are learned about effective outreach. Communication channels should be two -way, providing 
multiple opportunit ies for stakeholders to share information, good practices, and lessons in adapting to sea Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
254 level rise. A sea level rise conference could be organized every two years to facilitate the process of sharing 
lessons learned and good practices. Further, t he Clima te Adaptation Portal could be expanded to provide 
communities opportunities to share the sea level rise adaptation stories, good practices and  a venue  to ask 
questions. Partnerships with the University of Hawaiʻi Sea Grant College Program and others should  be 
leveraged to provide support  for education and outreach . 
9.4 Develop a monitoring and evaluation plan with benchmarks and indicators to support the 5 -
year update process  
The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission should develop a monitoring and evaluation plan that wo uld provide the 
data and information needed for anticipatory and adaptive management as part of the 5 -year update 
process. The process of adapting to sea level rise would  be implemented over time. As adaptation 
strategies and practices are proposed and imp lemented, there is a need to monitor, evaluate, and document 
the effectiveness o f these efforts in reducing risk and supporting sustainable and resilient communities in 
the face of sea level rise. The learning questions provided in each chapter of this Rep ort can serve as a 
framework for developing a monitoring and evaluation plan with measurable indicators and targets to track 
progress and document successes and lessons learned. Benchmarks and indicators adopted by City & 
County of Honolulu’s participation  in the 100 Resilient Cities Initiative may be relevant to monitoring 
progress toward increasing Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise.  
Documentation of successful approaches and lessons learned would  support c ontinuous and shared 
learning for effec tive and efficient adaptation. The goal of increasing Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level 
rise along with selected indicators and targets should be included as part of the Aloha+ Challenge 
Dashboard . The Dashboard  is an online open data platform to tra ck progress, provide accountability, and 
ensure transparency o f the Aloha+ Challenge , which is a state -wide commitment to sustainability.  The 
online dashboard is designed for decision makers, practitioners, and the public to inform policy, data driven 
decision making, and inspire action on Hawa ii’s state -wide sustainability goals.  
Another example of a successful monitoring and evaluation tool is t he Los Angeles Mayor’s Dashboard 
(City of Los Angeles 2017) , which provides information on the provision of various city services and planning 
efforts. The t ool represents an innovative, data -based approach to public transparency and governmental 
accountability, while providing a mechanism through which residents can learn more about their city and 
efforts that are underway to work toward a prosperous, livable , safe, and well-run city.   
Priorities, Sequencing, and Synergies  
As defined in the Introduction, this Report is first and foremost a technical report not a plan. The 
recommendations highlight actions to increase our capacity to adapt to sea level rise but  do not lay out a 
plan for implementation. The Hawaiʻi Climate Commission provides a collaborative multisectoral forum for 
furthering discussions on how, when, and where to implement many of these recommendations. During  the 
2nd Sea Level Rise Vulnerabilit y and Adaptation Workshop  held in February 2017, a number of 
recommendations were identified as  priorities to be fast -tracked for implementation through discussions Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
255 with the Hawaiʻi Climate Commission and other stakeholders. In addition, sequencing conside rations and 
synergies among the recommendations need to be recognized and planned for. These priorities, 
sequencing, and synergies are described below to begin the discussion for transforming from “business as 
usual” to concrete, implementable actions.  
Education and outreach at all levels  was identified as a priority. This includes state and county government, 
the private sector, and the public including children. A comprehensive education and outreach program on 
sea level rise vulnerability and adaptation (Recommended Action 9.3) is needed to communicate the results 
of this Report and engage stakeholders over the long -term. A communication and outreach strategy and 
clear and consistent messaging and materials, such as factsheets, presentations, and other ma terials,  are 
needed to support questions from the public as well as from state and county agencies and other 
stakeholders. Engaging communities in monitoring the impacts of sea level rise (Recommended Action 8.2) 
should form one component of this education  and outreach program that would not only raise public 
awareness of the impacts of sea level rise but also generate ideas and lessons on how to adapt. Continued 
support of DLNR, OCCL and other entities, such as the Office of Planning , CZM, and county partn ers 
(Recommended Action 9.2) is needed to support a state -wide response to sea level rise. Staff and funding 
for OCCL would not only support the education and outreach program, but provide technical and 
administrative support to the Hawaiʻi Climate Commiss ion (Recommended Action 9.3) on all matters related 
to sea level rise.  
State and county agencies have been asking for guidance on planning for sea level rise. The use of the 
SLR-XA with 3.2 feet of sea level rise as a vulnerability zone (Recommended Actio n 1.1), identified as a 
priority by state and county agencies, would serve as an important benchmark for planning. While sea level 
rise projections used to develop the vulnerability zones may need to be updated as new science and 
modeling become available (Recommended Action 8.1), this eventuality should not paralyze (i.e., “paralysis 
by analysis”) the use of this vulnerability zone for strategic planning now. Complementary Recommended 
Actions 2.1 and 3.1, and 3.3 should be considered to provide state vulne rability zone design standards and 
regulatory flood controls for new development and critical infrastructure in areas subjected to chronic and 
event -based flooding. Guidance on integrating community resilience to coastal hazard and sea level rise 
(Recommen ded Actions 1.5) would also help the State, Counties, and communities use the results of this 
Report and other data and information for planning.  
A lands inventory (Recommended Action 1.3) should be conducted to identify opportunities and constraints 
for redevelopment within urban land use zones of each county. These opportunities and constraints would 
help to identify critical infrastructure that needs to be protected or relocated, potential areas for 
redevelopment as part of a managed retreat strategy, an d areas that need to be preserved for ecological, 
cultural, recreation, and economic values. In addition to the lands inventory, the identification of shoreline 
protection and preservation priorities (Recommended Action 1.6) and legacy beach conservation p riorities 
(Recommended Action 4.1) should be fast -tracked to help place boundary conditions on shoreline armoring 
needed to support planning and enable legacy beaches to persist. Together, these recommendations 
should provide the basis for identifying prio rity target areas for redevelopment (Recommended Action 3.2). Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
256 Finally, guidance is needed on integrating adaptation to sea level rise into state, county and community 
plans (Recommended Action 1.5) as part of comprehensive managed retreat strategies. As pa rt of this 
guidance, the development of a community visioning process was identified during stakeholder 
consultation s and workshops  as a pri ority to help communities plan for sea level rise. This guidance can be 
developed now and updated over time as new r equirements and priorities are established.  
The Hawaiʻi  Climate Commission should support the establishment of a committee to develop prioritization 
criteria for identifying priority target areas  for smart redevelopment as a part of a managed retreat stra tegy 
(Recommended Action 2.2) . An early action could be to integrate sea level rise in the environmental review 
process and the Hawai‘i CZM Act (Recommended Actions 2.9 and 2.10). All major new development and 
capital improvement projects should be subject ed to an in -depth analysis of sea level rise impacts based 
on elevation, tolerance for risk, and lifetime of the structure (Recommended Action 2.7). Overall, there is a 
need for in -depth assessment of vulnerability and evaluation of adaptation strategies f or all critical 
infrastructure through the State (Recommended Action 8.3).  
Technical and financial support is needed to initiate a state -wide CRS program (Recommended Action  3.3). 
Participation in the CRS improves flood risk management for both riverine an d coastal flooding and provides 
incentivizes in terms of lower flood insurance rate premiums. The State and Counties should work together 
to identify actions that can be taken to obtain credits to enable CRS participation by Kaua‘i and O‘ahu and 
to increas e the CRS rating of Maui and Hawaiʻi. The following recommendations may contribute to credits 
under the CRS: (a) developing education and outreach on improving flood risk management ( as part of 
Recommended Action  10.1), (b) integrating coastal hazards with  sea level rise in hazard mitigation plans 
(Recommended Action  4.5, identified priority), (c) encouraging property owners located outside FEMA -
designated flood zones to purchase flo od insurance (Recommended Action  4.4), and (d) requiring the 
mandatory disc losure for private properties and public offerings located in areas with potential exposure to  
sea level rise (Recommended Actions  8.3 and 10.1).  
The coastal modeling and vulnerability assessment presented in this Report would need to be reviewed as 
part o f the 5 -year update process (Recommended Action 8.1) as mandated under Act 32. The Hawaiʻi 
Climate Commission should set priorities for (Recommended Action 9.2) the 5 -year update of this Report 
and develop a monitoring and evaluation plan to track progress  (Recommended Action 9.5) and support a 
learning and adaptive management approach. Research, assessment and monitoring priorities should be 
identified to support the 5 -year update (Recommended Action 8.4). These priorities should be funded now.  
Finally, f inancing and incentives for sea level rise adaptation (Recommendation 7) are needed to support 
many of these recommendations. As part of a multi -pronged financing strategy (Recommended Action 7.2), 
the establishment of a sea level rise adaptation trust fun d, if established now with a core amount and regular 
and modest inputs over time, could accrue to a substantial and sustainable financing means to help highly 
vulnerable and low -income residents with buy -out programs (Recommended Action 7.5) or other adapt ation 
measures. The exploration of TDRs and PDRs (Recommended Action 7.4) to facilitate managed retreat 
from the shoreline was identified as a priority. Further, TDRs and PDRs should be prioritized to support Hawaiʻi Sea Level Rise Vulnerability and Adaptation Report  
257 legacy beach conservation priorities (Recommended Action 4.1). The mandatory disclosure of sea level 
rise risks of real estate listings of private property and public offerings (Recommended Action 7. 3) was 
identified as a priority action to raise awareness of the risks of sea level rise . A range of incentives need to 
be identified (Recommended Action  3.9) to promote improved flood risk management and reduce the costs 
of adaptation and disaster recover y. 
Learning Questions for the 5 -Year Report Update  
Learning questions for this recommendation chapter highlight the need to monitor the status of 
implementation of the recommendations as well as lessons learned and successes achieved along the 
way. As such , learning questions for the 5 -year Report update include:  
1. What recommendations have been implemented and why?  
2. What recommendations have not been implemented and why?  
3. What have been barriers to implementation and measures taken to overcome these barriers?  
4. To what extent has Hawaii’s capacity to adapt to sea level rise increased based on benchmarks 
and measurable indicators?
