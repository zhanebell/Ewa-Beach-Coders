Our mission is to advocate for accessible treatment and support, empowering everyone affected by mental illness to live fulfilling lives in the community they choose. Together, we envision a brighter future for mental health across our islands. How our council works Our council exists to serve as a voice for Hawaii’s citizens. Through our monthly meetings, we invite all members of the community – from family members, to government officials, or experts in their fields, to come and share insights and concerns about the issues most affecting our island communities. Our advocacy efforts often take many forms – we write letters, support bills in the legislature, or simply help connect you to where you need to go given the complexities and wide range of government services. Serve on our council Join us to serve as a voice for all who have been diagnosed with mental illness throughout our island community.
