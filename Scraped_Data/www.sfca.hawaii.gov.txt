SFCA 2023-2024 BudgetWhat is a state arts agency?
The Hawaiʻi State Foundation on Culture and the Arts (SFCA) is Hawaiʻi’s state 
government arts agency, established in 1965 by the Hawaiʻi State Legislature, 
through the vision and effort of Hawaiʻi leaders including architect and State 
Planning Coordinator Alfred Pries, SFCA Founding Chairperson Masaru “Pundy” 
Yokouchi, State Senator Nadao Yoshinaga, and Governor John Burns. 
The creation of a state arts agency made Hawaiʻi eligible to receive federal 
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), newly established on 
September 29, 1965. The SFCA is administratively attached to the Department 
of Accounting and General Services�State arts agencies were created by legislatures and 
governors to promote the arts and reduce barriers to 
cultural participation� Every state and U �S� jurisdiction has 
a designated arts agency, providing grants, services, and 
leadership that make the arts accessible to everyone� State 
arts agencies help people and places to thrive by making 
our economy, our schools, our communities, and our 
connections with each other stronger through the arts�
State arts agencies are funded through appropriations 
from state legislatures. By law, state arts agencies also 
receive 40% of the federal grant dollars Congress provides 
to the National Endowment for the Arts�

the National Endowment for the Arts makes the arts available in 
more communities than it could through direct grants� The state arts 
agencies (such as the SFCA) greatly extend the federal reach and 
impact, translating national leadership into local benefit.
Grants are a major part of SFCA’s outreach, providing funding to 
support nonprofit organizations, individuals, and schools that 
provide training and services in the arts, culture and humanities 
across the state�

“Nā Akua Ākea (The Vast and Numerous Deities)” project,  
Hilo, Hawai‘i Island, Kumulā‘au Sing and Haunani Balino-Sing.
Nā Akua Ākea aimed to revive and perpetuate the traditional  
art of ‘ie‘ie weaving, a significant cultural heritage in Hawai‘i.  
The project encompassed several objectives:During the year-long cohort, Kumulā‘au and Haunani mentored six 
weavers in the traditional Hawaiian practice of ‘ie‘ie style basketry � 
The six haumāna learned to weave various forms of hīna‘i (braided 
basket), hīna‘i i‘a (braided basket fish trap), and ki‘i akua hulu manu; 
the ki‘i being the final project which showcases the knowledge and 
skills they acquired. An ‘ūniki graduation ceremony was held on 
Friday April 7, 2023 at Hawai’i Community College, Manono campus. 
The “Nā Akua Ākea Moku O Keawe Hilo-Pā‘ie‘ie” exhibit, showcasing 
the final student projects, was opened to public following the ‘ūniki. 
Additional information about the cohort and a video of the exhibit are 
on the Ke Kumu Hawai‘i website:

In addition to their kuleana with the Hilo cohort Kumula‘au and 
Haunani returned to Maui to continue instruction with their Maui ‘ie‘ie 
weaving cohort, which had been interrupted in 2019 due to COVID-19.• Perpetuate the art of ‘ie‘ie weaving through research,  
documentation, and hands-on practice.
• Transmitting this knowledge to na haumāna (students)  
of all ages through mentorship �
• Strengthening the community’s connections to their  
cultural roots�
• Showcasing the art form through public exhibitions  
and educational events�

Theatre for Youth (HTY) to develop “Under the Blue” , an art installation 
at the Hawai‘i State Art Museum that brought together visual artists, 
theatre artists and community members to create an immersive space 
and sensory friendly performance for young people with developmental 
differences. It was a journey through the different levels of the ocean that 
explored various animals and plants found in each of the ocean’s layers. 
The walls of the installation were curated and imagined by  
Solomon Enos� About a thousand museum visitors added  
millions of tiny dots to the walls over the course of two  
months, representing the plethora of phytoplankton that  
lives in the ocean� The coral reef and all the yarn creatures  
in the installation were made or curated by scientist and  
artist Michelle Schwengel-Regala� 
Under  
the Blue
SFCA and HTY continued their partnership by transforming the 
immersive experience into a performance into a touring school show 
from August to November 2023. HTY also toured free performances at 
selected public libraries on O‘ahu, Hawai‘i Island, Maui, and Kaua‘i in 
September and October of 2023 with sponsorship from the Friends of 
the Library of Hawai‘i.

Museum Without W alls: Arts Education Pilot Programs
In FY2023, the SFCA ran two pilot programs for Museum Without 
Walls: Arts Education, an SFCA initiative to bring arts education into 
non-school spaces� The programs took place at The Plaza Kaneohe 
for senior care residents, and at Adventist Heath Castle hospital for 
medical workers and their families� SFCA Artistic Teaching Partners 
Denise Karabinus and Tamara Moan led visual arts residencies over 
several weeks. Art making was taught as an opportunity to meditate, 
reflect, connect, and reduce stress.

The exhibit was led by international artist and SFCA Artistic 
Teaching Partner Fatiha Kheddaoui, assisted by Dominique Meyer 
Gere. 60 backpacks transformed into works of art were displayed, 
showcasing the creativity and resilience of the young artists�
This was a collaborative effort between RYSE youth and Moanalua 
High School students from Mr. Kalma’s English Honors classes.Residential Youth Services and Empowerment (RYSE)  
and Moanalua High School created “Not All Backpacks 
Carry the Same Weight,” an art exhibit featuring  
backpacks redesigned by homeless youth and 
Moanalua High School’s English Honors classes.
“The students and youth worked independently,  
but simultaneously, on the designs and creative  
implementation of each backpack. Through  
creativity, we discussed and explored the stigmas  
of homelessness and its impact on young people,”
—KHEDDAOUI
“By creating more visibility of our youth in art institutions,  
we invite people to see them as part of the community.”

SFCA’s Arts Education programs engage participants in the artistic  
processes of C�P �R�C: 
• Creating (making art)
• Performing/Presenting (sharing our art with others)
• Responding (thinking/reflecting about art)
• Connecting (relating ideas and works with context to deepen understanding)
These are the anchors of the National Core Arts Standards, a process that guides 
educators in providing a unified quality arts education for students pre-K through high

PROVIDES SKILLS CRITICAL TO 21ST CENTURY SUCCESS” “ Arts education provides skills vital to 21st-century success:“ Arts education provides skills vital to 21st-century success:   
critical thinking, creative problem-solving, collaboration,  
communication, and information literacy. In a global economy  
driven by knowledge and ideas, arts education is a necessity.  
The best-paying jobs require workers with creativity and higher-  
order thinking and communication skills, and companies are  
increasingly looking for these qualities in the workers they  
recruit. In studying the arts, students hone their perceptual,  
analytic, and interpretive skills while developing creative thinking, 
communications, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally,  
74% of educators say that the risk of job automation is lower in  
professions that require creative problem-solving skills.”1“

classes where the arts are absent �1 
Arts education helps close achievement gaps for disadvantaged students
Research confirms that students 
from low-income families, English 
language learners, and students 
with special needs all do better 
in arts-infused schools than in 
schools that do not have robust 
arts programming as a meaningful 
part of the curriculum.2
“Our students look forward to [Artistic 
Teaching Partner Ellen Crocker] coming 
and there are countless times that they 
have asked when she will be here next and 
students remember the units even years

some of the lessons are starting to  
become part of our Modern History of

The Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate Program has concluded its  
first year of a three-year initiative. 
Launched in 2022 by the Hawai‘i Council for the Humanities in  
partnership with the Hawai‘i State Foundation on Culture and  
 the Arts, the State Librarian and other community stakeholders,  
 the Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate recognizes and honors a Hawai‘i  
poet of exceptional talent and accomplishment � The program  
is intended to promote and encourage appreciation of poetry  
and literary life in Hawai‘i through events, publications, workshops,  
and readings featuring local poets� The fellowship awards  
$20,000 year and helps activate poetry in communities  
throughout the state�
In her first year as Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate, Brandy Nālani 
McDougall actively engaged with communities through readings, 
public appearances, and participation in local events including 
the 2023 Art at the Capitol, The Vibe at Capitol Modern (Hawai‘i 
State Art Museum), and the Shangri-La Museum of Islamic Art, 
Culture, and Design.

Brandy Nālani McDougall is a Kānaka

University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. Her 
second poetry collection, “‘ Āina Hānau, 
Birth Land”, was published in the  
summer of 2023.I aim for my work to contribute to a poetry of  
healing—a poetry that confronts and speaks the truth 
of personal, colonial and collective trauma, while  
also reflecting on how to work through that trauma, 
how to have hope, and how to grow stronger  
through connections to ‘āina and community. Above 
all, I hope people may be inspired to write their  
own poems and stories of ‘āina and community, to 
articulate their own truth, and in doing so, to feel  
the strength, aloha and sense of connection that has 
been with them all along.

King Kamehameha  
Celebration Commission
On December 22, 1871, King Kamehameha V proclaimed a national holiday  
to honor and celebrate his grandfather and the father of the Hawaiian  
Kingdom. Originally, the people of Hawai‘i wanted to mark the legacy of  
Lot Kapūaiwa (Kamehameha V) on his birthday, December 11. Being the  
humble chief that he was, he opted to honor his grandfather instead and pushed the 
holiday as far away from his (Lot’s) birthday as possible,  
hence the arbitrary date of June 11. Thus, June 11, 1872, was the very first Kame -
hameha Day holiday ever celebrated.

About the ARTS FIRST Partners
FY2023 Highlights and Accomplishments
In 1999, the Hawai‘i State Legislature enacted ACT 80, which called for Hawai‘i’s major stakehold -
ers in arts education to revise the State’s Fine Arts standards and develop a statewide Strategic 
Plan for Arts Education. In 2001, ACT 306/01 passed into law (SFCA’s HRS Chapter 9) formally 
naming the ARTS FIRST Partners and mandating the implementation of the Strategic Plan�
Current ARTS FIRST Partners include the State of Hawai‘i Department of Education; Hawai‘i As -
sociation of Independent Schools; College of Arts and Humanities - University of Hawai‘i-Mānoa; 
College of Education - University of Hawai‘i-Mānoa (UHM COE); Hawai‘i State Foundation on Cul -
ture and the Arts (SFCA); Hawai‘i Arts Alliance; Holualoa Foundation for Arts and Culture (Donkey 
Mill Art Center); Honolulu Theatre for Youth; Maui Arts & Cultural Center; Molokai Arts Center. Any 
not-for-profit arts education focused organization in Hawai‘i is welcome to attend meetings.
On March 3, 2022, the Hawaiʻi State Board of Education adopted the National Core Arts 
Standards (NCAS) for grades K-12, effective July 1, 2022, for the Hawaiʻi State Department 
of Education (Department) schools and July 1, 2025, for charter schools. The NCAS replaces 
the Hawaii Content and Performance Standards Ill for Fine Arts K-12. The Department will 
initiate a three-year implementation rollout beginning with School Year (SY) 2022-2023, with full 
implementation of the NCAS in SY 2025-2026. Since the adoption, ARTS FIRST partners have been 
assisting in the implementation and rollout phase of the standards, which will run through 2025.
Hawaiʻi Community Foundation, a Hawaiʻi-based nonprofit organization, hosted an ARTS 
FIRST retreat in July 2022. The retreat invited new partners and discussed a plan for the 
next 3 years, including the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Education (DOE) adoption of the 
National Core Arts Standards and crafting a public awareness campaign for arts education�  
In addition, various organizations within ARTS FIRST supported Professional Development 
for teachers, teaching artists and community members. Several sessions had a focus on 
culturally responsive and sustaining teaching methods. Professional Development this year 
was held online and in person on Maui, the Big Island and Oʻahu. ARTS FIRST PARTNERS             25 Federal Funds

FY2023 ART IN PUBLIC PLACES COLLECTION PURCHASES AND GIFTS
The APP Program acquires works of art and commissions 
artists to create works of art for specific locations. These 
works of art are displayed in over 500 sites statewide� 
2 artwork commissions were encumbered this year and 
71 artworks from 22 exhibits and venues were purchased�  
Works of art are purchased through a community process 
where an Acquisition Award Selection Committee (AASC) 
is convened to select works of art for purchase from public 
galleries, studios of master artists, gifts, and other approved 
sources� The AASC follows selection criteria to recommend 
artwork to the SFCA Board of Commissioners for approval to purchase. This year, AASC’s visited 23 exhibits on Hawaiʻi 
Island, Kauaʻi, Maui, and Oʻahu, and recommended 100 art -
works for purchase (note: the number of nominations and 
purchases differ as the purchase date of an artwork may 
be in a different fiscal year than the nomination). To learn 
more about how exhibit organizers can invite an AASC to 
an exhibit, please visit the SFCA website: SFCA.Hawaii.

SFCA ARTISTS IN THE SCHOOLS 
All public and charter schools in the state can apply annually for a PreK-12 arts residency grant � Schools are required to use an artist from the 
SFCA Artistic Teaching Partners Roster. Most elementary schools do not have arts specialists despite the arts being considered a core subject, 
so most of the applications serve elementary grades. AITS offers residencies in dance, drama, music, literary arts, and visual arts. In FY2023, 
12,850 children and 1,493 adults in 120 schools were reached statewide through Artists in the Schools.
This year, 124 school grant applications were received and reviewed; 120 were awarded grants. Applications are reviewed by a Grant Review 
Panel of individuals with a deep understaning of arts education and who reside on different islands. Panelists are volunteers and do not 
receive compensation� 
The AITS program follows Hawai ʻi Administrative Rules, Chapters 3-92 to 3-93 concerning panel and application adminstration. 
The Hawaiʻi Community Foundation (HCF) has contributed matching funds since 2008 with direct funding to the Artistic Teaching Partner 
501(c)(3) organizations that are working with the selected AITS schools.

the “Hānau Hou Ka Hula Ki‘i, Rebirthing Hula Ki‘i in the 21st Century” exhibit at the 
Downtown Art Center in Honolulu, July 10-30, 2022. Mitchell received an SFCA Folk 
and Traditional Arts Apprentice Mentoring grant for hula ki‘i in 2020. With that grant, 
apprentices Meleanna Meyer and Ka‘ai‘ohelo MacAfee learned to carve the ki‘i, make 
the kapa attire, and learn the mo‘olelo to perform with the ki‘i.
The Bishop Museum, partnered with the PA’I Foundation’s Maoli Arts Movement 
initiative, presented “Ola Ka No’eau: Excellence in Hawaiian Artistry” March 11 – 
October 15, 2023. This exhibition explored the geneaology of Hawaiian artistry, 
particularly through generational transmission of knowledge� Featured artists

Paulette Kahalepuna, Mary Louise Kekuewa, and Kawika Lum-Nelmida. Additionally, 
artists Roen Hufford, Marie McDonald, Imaikalani Kalahele, Cory Taum, and Kunane 
Wooton have artworks in the SFCA Art in Public Places Collection�Roen Hufford, Kapa Maker from Waimea, Hawai‘i, has been honored as one of the  
2023 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) National Heritage Fellows . Hufford  
carries on the labor-intensive traditional art of ka hana kapa (making barkcloth)  
with designs inspired by the richness of her Hawaiian environment and is a leading  
figure in the reclaiming of this nearly lost art. Hufford cultivates hundreds of wauke trees for 
making kapa on her families Hawaiian Homelands farm�

SFCA 2023-2024 BudgetWhat is a state arts agency?
The Hawaiʻi State Foundation on Culture and the Arts (SFCA) is Hawaiʻi’s state 
government arts agency, established in 1965 by the Hawaiʻi State Legislature, 
through the vision and effort of Hawaiʻi leaders including architect and State 
Planning Coordinator Alfred Pries, SFCA Founding Chairperson Masaru “Pundy” 
Yokouchi, State Senator Nadao Yoshinaga, and Governor John Burns. 
The creation of a state arts agency made Hawaiʻi eligible to receive federal 
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), newly established on 
September 29, 1965. The SFCA is administratively attached to the Department 
of Accounting and General Services�State arts agencies were created by legislatures and 
governors to promote the arts and reduce barriers to 
cultural participation� Every state and U �S� jurisdiction has 
a designated arts agency, providing grants, services, and 
leadership that make the arts accessible to everyone� State 
arts agencies help people and places to thrive by making 
our economy, our schools, our communities, and our 
connections with each other stronger through the arts�
State arts agencies are funded through appropriations 
from state legislatures. By law, state arts agencies also 
receive 40% of the federal grant dollars Congress provides 
to the National Endowment for the Arts�

the National Endowment for the Arts makes the arts available in 
more communities than it could through direct grants� The state arts 
agencies (such as the SFCA) greatly extend the federal reach and 
impact, translating national leadership into local benefit.
Grants are a major part of SFCA’s outreach, providing funding to 
support nonprofit organizations, individuals, and schools that 
provide training and services in the arts, culture and humanities 
across the state�

“Nā Akua Ākea (The Vast and Numerous Deities)” project,  
Hilo, Hawai‘i Island, Kumulā‘au Sing and Haunani Balino-Sing.
Nā Akua Ākea aimed to revive and perpetuate the traditional  
art of ‘ie‘ie weaving, a significant cultural heritage in Hawai‘i.  
The project encompassed several objectives:During the year-long cohort, Kumulā‘au and Haunani mentored six 
weavers in the traditional Hawaiian practice of ‘ie‘ie style basketry � 
The six haumāna learned to weave various forms of hīna‘i (braided 
basket), hīna‘i i‘a (braided basket fish trap), and ki‘i akua hulu manu; 
the ki‘i being the final project which showcases the knowledge and 
skills they acquired. An ‘ūniki graduation ceremony was held on 
Friday April 7, 2023 at Hawai’i Community College, Manono campus. 
The “Nā Akua Ākea Moku O Keawe Hilo-Pā‘ie‘ie” exhibit, showcasing 
the final student projects, was opened to public following the ‘ūniki. 
Additional information about the cohort and a video of the exhibit are

In addition to their kuleana with the Hilo cohort Kumula‘au and 
Haunani returned to Maui to continue instruction with their Maui ‘ie‘ie 
weaving cohort, which had been interrupted in 2019 due to COVID-19.• Perpetuate the art of ‘ie‘ie weaving through research,  
documentation, and hands-on practice.
• Transmitting this knowledge to na haumāna (students)  
of all ages through mentorship �
• Strengthening the community’s connections to their  
cultural roots�
• Showcasing the art form through public exhibitions  
and educational events�

Theatre for Youth (HTY) to develop “Under the Blue” , an art installation 
at the Hawai‘i State Art Museum that brought together visual artists, 
theatre artists and community members to create an immersive space 
and sensory friendly performance for young people with developmental 
differences. It was a journey through the different levels of the ocean that 
explored various animals and plants found in each of the ocean’s layers. 
The walls of the installation were curated and imagined by  
Solomon Enos� About a thousand museum visitors added  
millions of tiny dots to the walls over the course of two  
months, representing the plethora of phytoplankton that  
lives in the ocean� The coral reef and all the yarn creatures  
in the installation were made or curated by scientist and  
artist Michelle Schwengel-Regala� 
Under  
the Blue
SFCA and HTY continued their partnership by transforming the 
immersive experience into a performance into a touring school show 
from August to November 2023. HTY also toured free performances at 
selected public libraries on O‘ahu, Hawai‘i Island, Maui, and Kaua‘i in 
September and October of 2023 with sponsorship from the Friends of 
the Library of Hawai‘i.

Museum Without W alls: Arts Education Pilot Programs
In FY2023, the SFCA ran two pilot programs for Museum Without 
Walls: Arts Education, an SFCA initiative to bring arts education into 
non-school spaces� The programs took place at The Plaza Kaneohe 
for senior care residents, and at Adventist Heath Castle hospital for 
medical workers and their families� SFCA Artistic Teaching Partners 
Denise Karabinus and Tamara Moan led visual arts residencies over 
several weeks. Art making was taught as an opportunity to meditate, 
reflect, connect, and reduce stress.

The exhibit was led by international artist and SFCA Artistic

Gere. 60 backpacks transformed into works of art were displayed, 
showcasing the creativity and resilience of the young artists�
This was a collaborative effort between RYSE youth and Moanalua 
High School students from Mr. Kalma’s English Honors classes.Residential Youth Services and Empowerment (RYSE)  
and Moanalua High School created “Not All Backpacks 
Carry the Same Weight,” an art exhibit featuring  
backpacks redesigned by homeless youth and 
Moanalua High School’s English Honors classes.
“The students and youth worked independently,  
but simultaneously, on the designs and creative  
implementation of each backpack. Through  
creativity, we discussed and explored the stigmas  
of homelessness and its impact on young people,”
—KHEDDAOUI
“By creating more visibility of our youth in art institutions,  
we invite people to see them as part of the community.”

PROVIDES SKILLS CRITICAL TO 21ST CENTURY SUCCESS” “ Arts education provides skills vital to 21st-century success:“ Arts education provides skills vital to 21st-century success:   
critical thinking, creative problem-solving, collaboration,  
communication, and information literacy. In a global economy  
driven by knowledge and ideas, arts education is a necessity.  
The best-paying jobs require workers with creativity and higher-  
order thinking and communication skills, and companies are  
increasingly looking for these qualities in the workers they  
recruit. In studying the arts, students hone their perceptual,  
analytic, and interpretive skills while developing creative thinking, 
communications, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally,  
74% of educators say that the risk of job automation is lower in  
professions that require creative problem-solving skills.”1“

Launched in 2022 by the Hawai‘i Council for the Humanities in  
partnership with the Hawai‘i State Foundation on Culture and  
 the Arts, the State Librarian and other community stakeholders,  
 the Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate recognizes and honors a Hawai‘i  
poet of exceptional talent and accomplishment � The program  
is intended to promote and encourage appreciation of poetry  
and literary life in Hawai‘i through events, publications, workshops,  
and readings featuring local poets� The fellowship awards  
$20,000 year and helps activate poetry in communities  
throughout the state�
In her first year as Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate, Brandy Nālani 
McDougall actively engaged with communities through readings, 
public appearances, and participation in local events including 
the 2023 Art at the Capitol, The Vibe at Capitol Modern (Hawai‘i

second poetry collection, “‘ Āina Hānau,

healing—a poetry that confronts and speaks the truth 
of personal, colonial and collective trauma, while  
also reflecting on how to work through that trauma, 
how to have hope, and how to grow stronger  
through connections to ‘āina and community. Above 
all, I hope people may be inspired to write their  
own poems and stories of ‘āina and community, to 
articulate their own truth, and in doing so, to feel  
the strength, aloha and sense of connection that has 
been with them all along.

Program Highlights
As a part of the SFCA’s Art in Public Places Program, the intention 
of the State Art Museum is to explore creative and dynamic ways 
to support artists and their diverse art forms� This is accomplished 
through public programming, museum education, and engagement. 
We are continuously evolving in becoming even more inclusionary 
and accessible to the needs of our community, as a welcoming space 
for creatives to collaborate, share and encourage one another in the 
arts�
The State Foundation on Culture and the Arts partnered with

King Kamehameha  
Celebration Commission
On December 22, 1871, King Kamehameha V proclaimed a national holiday  
to honor and celebrate his grandfather and the father of the Hawaiian  
Kingdom. Originally, the people of Hawai‘i wanted to mark the legacy of  
Lot Kapūaiwa (Kamehameha V) on his birthday, December 11. Being the  
humble chief that he was, he opted to honor his grandfather instead and pushed the 
holiday as far away from his (Lot’s) birthday as possible,  
hence the arbitrary date of June 11. Thus, June 11, 1872, was the very first Kame -
hameha Day holiday ever celebrated.

About the ARTS FIRST Partners
FY2023 Highlights and Accomplishments
In 1999, the Hawai‘i State Legislature enacted ACT 80, which called for Hawai‘i’s major stakehold -
ers in arts education to revise the State’s Fine Arts standards and develop a statewide Strategic 
Plan for Arts Education. In 2001, ACT 306/01 passed into law (SFCA’s HRS Chapter 9) formally 
naming the ARTS FIRST Partners and mandating the implementation of the Strategic Plan�
Current ARTS FIRST Partners include the State of Hawai‘i Department of Education; Hawai‘i As -
sociation of Independent Schools; College of Arts and Humanities - University of Hawai‘i-Mānoa; 
College of Education - University of Hawai‘i-Mānoa (UHM COE); Hawai‘i State Foundation on Cul -
ture and the Arts (SFCA); Hawai‘i Arts Alliance; Holualoa Foundation for Arts and Culture (Donkey 
Mill Art Center); Honolulu Theatre for Youth; Maui Arts & Cultural Center; Molokai Arts Center. Any 
not-for-profit arts education focused organization in Hawai‘i is welcome to attend meetings.
On March 3, 2022, the Hawaiʻi State Board of Education adopted the National Core Arts 
Standards (NCAS) for grades K-12, effective July 1, 2022, for the Hawaiʻi State Department 
of Education (Department) schools and July 1, 2025, for charter schools. The NCAS replaces 
the Hawaii Content and Performance Standards Ill for Fine Arts K-12. The Department will 
initiate a three-year implementation rollout beginning with School Year (SY) 2022-2023, with full 
implementation of the NCAS in SY 2025-2026. Since the adoption, ARTS FIRST partners have been 
assisting in the implementation and rollout phase of the standards, which will run through 2025.
Hawaiʻi Community Foundation, a Hawaiʻi-based nonprofit organization, hosted an ARTS 
FIRST retreat in July 2022. The retreat invited new partners and discussed a plan for the 
next 3 years, including the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Education (DOE) adoption of the 
National Core Arts Standards and crafting a public awareness campaign for arts education�  
In addition, various organizations within ARTS FIRST supported Professional Development 
for teachers, teaching artists and community members. Several sessions had a focus on 
culturally responsive and sustaining teaching methods. Professional Development this year 
was held online and in person on Maui, the Big Island and Oʻahu. ARTS FIRST PARTNERS             25 Federal Funds

FY2023 ART IN PUBLIC PLACES COLLECTION PURCHASES AND GIFTS
The APP Program acquires works of art and commissions 
artists to create works of art for specific locations. These 
works of art are displayed in over 500 sites statewide� 
2 artwork commissions were encumbered this year and 
71 artworks from 22 exhibits and venues were purchased�  
Works of art are purchased through a community process 
where an Acquisition Award Selection Committee (AASC) 
is convened to select works of art for purchase from public 
galleries, studios of master artists, gifts, and other approved 
sources� The AASC follows selection criteria to recommend 
artwork to the SFCA Board of Commissioners for approval to purchase. This year, AASC’s visited 23 exhibits on Hawaiʻi 
Island, Kauaʻi, Maui, and Oʻahu, and recommended 100 art -
works for purchase (note: the number of nominations and 
purchases differ as the purchase date of an artwork may 
be in a different fiscal year than the nomination). To learn 
more about how exhibit organizers can invite an AASC to 
an exhibit, please visit the SFCA website: SFCA.Hawaii.

SFCA ARTISTS IN THE SCHOOLS 
All public and charter schools in the state can apply annually for a PreK-12 arts residency grant � Schools are required to use an artist from the 
SFCA Artistic Teaching Partners Roster. Most elementary schools do not have arts specialists despite the arts being considered a core subject, 
so most of the applications serve elementary grades. AITS offers residencies in dance, drama, music, literary arts, and visual arts. In FY2023, 
12,850 children and 1,493 adults in 120 schools were reached statewide through Artists in the Schools.
This year, 124 school grant applications were received and reviewed; 120 were awarded grants. Applications are reviewed by a Grant Review 
Panel of individuals with a deep understaning of arts education and who reside on different islands. Panelists are volunteers and do not 
receive compensation� 
The AITS program follows Hawai ʻi Administrative Rules, Chapters 3-92 to 3-93 concerning panel and application adminstration. 
The Hawaiʻi Community Foundation (HCF) has contributed matching funds since 2008 with direct funding to the Artistic Teaching Partner 
501(c)(3) organizations that are working with the selected AITS schools.

the “Hānau Hou Ka Hula Ki‘i, Rebirthing Hula Ki‘i in the 21st Century” exhibit at the 
Downtown Art Center in Honolulu, July 10-30, 2022. Mitchell received an SFCA Folk

Paulette Kahalepuna, Mary Louise Kekuewa, and Kawika Lum-Nelmida. Additionally, 
artists Roen Hufford, Marie McDonald, Imaikalani Kalahele, Cory Taum, and Kunane 
Wooton have artworks in the SFCA Art in Public Places Collection�Roen Hufford, Kapa Maker from Waimea, Hawai‘i, has been honored as one of the  
2023 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) National Heritage Fellows . Hufford  
carries on the labor-intensive traditional art of ka hana kapa (making barkcloth)  
with designs inspired by the richness of her Hawaiian environment and is a leading  
figure in the reclaiming of this nearly lost art. Hufford cultivates hundreds of wauke trees for 
making kapa on her families Hawaiian Homelands farm�

The Hawai‘i State Foundation on Culture and the 
Arts (SFCA) is Hawaii’s state government arts agency. 
Established in 1965 by the Hawai‘i State Legislature, 
through the vision and effort of Hawai‘i leaders  
including architect and State Planning Coordinator  
Alfred Pries, SFCA Founding Chairperson Masaru  
“Pundy” Yokouchi, State Senator Nadao Yoshinaga, 
and Governor John Burns. The creation of a state  
arts agency made Hawai‘i eligible to receive federal  
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts  
(NEA), newly established on September 29, 1965. The 
SFCA is administratively attached to the Department  
of Accounting and General Services.
WHAT IS A STATE ARTS AGENCY?
State arts agencies were created by legislatures and 
governors to promote the arts and reduce barriers to 
cultural participation. Every state and U.S. jurisdiction 
has a designated arts agency, providing grants, services, 
and leadership that make the arts accessible to everyone. 
State arts agencies help people and places to thrive by 
making our economy, our schools, our communities, and 
our connections with each other stronger through the arts.
State arts agencies are funded through appropriations 
from state legislatures. State arts agencies also receive 
40% of the federal grant dollars Congress provides to the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
Learn more about state arts agencies and regional arts 
organizations nationwide on the National Assembly of 
State Arts Agencies website: NASAA-Arts.org/state-  
arts-agencies.

COMMUNITY MAHALO! 06  |WHY ENGAGEMENT MATTERSWE VIEW ART AND CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT AS CRITICAL TO  
THE EDUCATIONAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING  
OF INDIVIDUALS, COMMUNITIES, AND THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I.
Through our programs, we encourage people to embrace creative expression as an integral 
part of life in Hawai‘i. Engagement includes arts integration in school curriculums, such as 
SFCA’s Artists in the Schools residencies for grades K–12, interactive technology like SFCA 
partner Honolulu Theatre for Youth’s “‘Imi Ā Loa‘a ,” and community programs, like Hawaiian 
History Month programming supported in part by grant funding from the SFCA.Exploring the Sculpture Garden at the State Art Museum through the “‘Imi Ā Loa‘a” interactive experience. 
Supported in part by grant funding from the SFCA, the Honolulu Theatre for Youth’s “‘Imi Ā Loa‘a” uses Augmented Reality, a walking tour, and digital gaming to engage people with art and history. Experience it yourself at the State Art Museum Sculpture Garden and borrow a tablet at the visitor’s desk!

WHY ENGAGENEMNT MATTERS |  072022 Annual Report2022 COMMUNITY 
PROJECT HIGHLIGHTSThe SFCA has distributed $759,500 to 41 Hawai‘i arts and culture organizations and  
20 individual arts/culture practitioners impacted by COVID-19. These American Rescue  
Plan (ARP) federal funds, provided by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), are  
designed to support the arts sector as it recovers from the devastating impact of COVID-19.
ARTIST IN THE SCHOOL (AITS) HIGHLIGHTS
“This year, our resident teacher added a presentation of learning opportunity at the end 
of the residency. We invited artists and makers from our community to come and see the 
pieces. The students also invited their parents. The pride that the students felt, even if their 
piece was not quite complete, was evident. 
A couple of our students are lobbying to establish this residency as a standing course 
offering in our course catalog. The students were articulate about the skills they learned 
through participation in this program and they feel that everyone should have the 
opportunity to take this residency as an elongated course offering. You know you  
have a successful residency when the students don’t want to stop learning!”
— TRACI SULLIVAN, MATH/SCIENCE TEACHER AT HAWAI‘I TECHNOLOGY 
ACADEMY KAUA‘I PCS (L ĪHU‘E, KAUA‘I)
“Students learned a way to see the world differently as they conducted their ethnographical 
interviews with family members and used this experience to write poetry. Students shared 
that they were grateful to have time with their families to sit down and hear their stories.”
— ANN TANAKA, AP ENGLISH TEACHER AT JAMES CAMPBELL HIGH SCHOOL 
(‘EWA BEACH, O‘AHU)
State Foundation on Culture and the Arts
2022 COMMUNITY PROJECTS HIGHLIGHTS 08  |“Students were able to understand the connection between Hawaiian cultural values in 
relationship to our native ohia forest and explored artistic expressions that communicated 
their feelings about the effects of rapid ohia death. Students found a creative approach 
to writing, various modes of expression, and multiple pathways of understanding of our 
environment and Hawaiian culture. In addition to the visual art projects, 3rd and 4th 
graders learned a Hawaiian mele “E Ala E Na Mamo E” to capture the importance of 
working together to meet challenges and to honor our ancestors of the past to move 
toward a better future. Environmental and cultural empathy became apparent among 
students. The artistic process truly allowed students to connect with ohia on a personal level.”

the chance to play along with the musicians or enjoy the “The SFCA ARP Recovery Grant funding allowed us to 
share unique cultural arts methods and applications like 
weaving lau hala, making a fishnet and learning how to 
throw it, and the process of making and stamping kapa 
cloth. Opportunities for visitors to see these traditional 
practices are rare; even rarer is having hands-on 
experience learning the practice or art form. The Living 
Culture Program Series is impactful in sustaining these 
traditional practices and sharing this important cultural 
knowledge. The benefit of personal interaction with 
practitioners is not limited to a first-time introduction 
to an activity. It is an opportunity for those who have a 
depth of cultural knowledge and experience to share 
what has been given to them with others.”

2022 COMMUNITY PROJECTS HIGHLIGHTS 10  |The Hawai‘i Opera Theatre (HOT) Opera Residency 
Program worked with four different schools. The residency 
program has several different variations which include 
a “create your own opera” project, a traditional residency 
using a work from our custom library of operas intended 
for performance by children, and special projects.
•Students at Blanche Pope Elementary worked with
the HOT Education Department to create their own
opera. They created a story based off another story
of old Waimānalo (where the school is located). They
used the mural painted on the side of their building to
help build their opera.
•He‘eia Elementary created an opera based off
Hawaiian marsh birds.
•Waikele Elementary used their location of Waipahu
for inspiration, while Pālolo Elementary created an
opera titled “Superheroes of the South Pacific.”
All these projects culminated in a performance for their 
peers and the community.

ARTS INTEGRATION GETS STUDENTS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING
“Using drama as a way of teaching early Hawaiian migration and society was an especially beneficial, 
effective, and fun approach for our high English Language Learner student population to learn. 
Through role-play or acting scenes out, students engaged with content on a deeper, emotional, 
visceral level. When my class traveled to Hawai‘i from Tahiti (pretending and acting), the students 
really began to understand the danger of such a long-distance voyage, and the skill necessary to the 
navigate 2,500 miles of open ocean!”

ARTS EDUCATION PROVIDES SKILLS VITAL TO 21ST-CENTURY SUCCESS
“Critical thinking, creative problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and information literacy. 
In a global economy driven by knowledge and ideas, arts education is a necessity. The best-paying 
jobs require workers with creativity and higher-order thinking and communication skills, and 
companies are increasingly looking for these qualities in the workers they recruit. In studying the  
arts, students hone their perceptual, analytic, and interpretive skills while developing creative 
thinking, communications, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, 74% of educators say that  
the risk of job automation is lower in professions that require creative problem-solving skills.”

The SFCA’s roster of ATP provides schools with highly qualified teaching artists. The 
ATP stay current with best arts education practices through ongoing training and  
professional development.
In 2022, 9 of 18 new teaching artists on the roster took part in an Emerging Teaching  
Artist Program. This program partnered Veteran Teaching Artists with Emerging Teaching 
Artists, to one-on-one support for curriculum development, lesson planning, and grant  
writing for their first year on the roster.
“The first adjustment for me was teaching a class in such a short time period. I had taught for 1-3 
hours in a museum setting. Managing to complete everything within the 45-minute timetable felt 
more challenging. [The mentor’s] feedback helped me best identify which parts of the lesson I 
should simplify and how to stagger the steps of the artmaking process to keep students engaged.”

The Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate program has launched! 
Congratulations to Hawai‘i State Poet Laureate Brandy Nālani 
McDougall, selected by a committee. Brandy is an accomplished 
Hawai‘i based poet who will help activate poetry in the community throughout the state of Hawai‘i for three years. This fellowship will 
award $20,000 per year. 
The program was initiated by the Hawai‘i Council for the Humanities, 
who reached out to SFCA  and began a dialogue of monthly meetings 
that included the State Librarian and others in the community to 
build the platform of the poet laurate. The group then reached out to Senator Brian Taniguchi to include his input. A committee brought the 
program to the attention of the state legislature via the concurrent 
resolution. Learn more about resolutions on the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) website: LRB.Hawaii.gov/PAR/overview-of-the-
legislative-process.
“Poetry has a unique contribution to make to our society — strengthening civic voice, empathy, and 
understanding, expanding our hearts. A State Poet Laureate Program will encourage and value 
poetry in our many communities and help to make poetry feel like it truly belongs to everyone as 
a powerful mode of expression, connection, and enriching way of life.”

ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM 18  |Bernice Akamine, Kapa Moe: Hae Hawai’i (detail) kapa, Hawaiian bark cloth, 2021. Hawaiian flag quilts were generally made in 
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many were made to honor the Hawaiian monarchy and then there were the “Annexation” 
quilts with their symbols of patriotic loyalty to the deposed Queen Liliuokalani. Kapa Moe: Hae Hawai’i strips the Hawaiian flag 
quilt down to its most basic element, the Hawaiian flag and speaks of patriotic pride and perseverance of the lāhui. The SFCA APP Collection has nearly 7,000 works of art, over 
65% of which is currently on display statewide in over 500 
state government sites including public schools, libraries, 
airports, hospitals, State office buildings, and HiSAM. The 
collection is managed by the SFCA for accountability,

•And making connections for gallery representation in
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
“Dear Saumolia” is a series of paintings to my younger 
self and current self: celebrating the innocence of my 
childhood, addressing the insecurities of my past/present, 
and expressing the triumphs of self-love and happiness 
through inclusivity. Throughout the month of October, I 
intend to share the space with other queer artists to 
celebrate our identity through fellowship.

KamehamehaDay.Hawaii.gov .On December 22, 1871, King Kamehameha V proclaimed a 
national holiday to honor and celebrate his grandfather 
and the father of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Originally, 
the people of Hawai‘i wanted to mark the legacy of Lot 
Kapūaiwa (Kamehameha V) on his birthday, December 11. 
Being the humble chief that he was, he opted to honor his 
grandfather instead and pushed the holiday as far away 
from his (Lot’s) birthday as possible, hence the arbitrary 
date of June 11. Thus, June 11, 1872, was the very first 
Kamehameha Day holiday ever celebrated.

The Hawai‘i State Legislature enacted ACT 80 in 1999 which called for Hawaii's major 
stakeholders in arts education to revise the State’s Fine Arts standards and develop 
a statewide Strategic Plan for Arts Education. In 2001, ACT 306/01 passed into law 
(SFCA’s HRS Chapter 9) formally naming the ARTS FIRST Partners and mandating the implementation of the Strategic Plan.
This year, the ARTS FIRST Partners assisted in the Board of Education’s adoption of the 
National Core Arts Standards. Since the adoption, various partners are assisting in the implementation and rollout phase of the standards, which will occur over the next  
3 years (2022–2025).
In addition, various organizations within ARTS FIRST supported Professional Development 
for teachers, teaching artists and community members. Several sessions had a focus on 
culturally responsive and sustaining teaching methods. Professional Development this year 
was held online and in person on islands including Maui, Hawai‘i Island, and O‘ahu.

ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM
The State Foundation on Culture and the Arts was established by the Hawai‘i State 
Legislature in 1965 as the official arts agency of the State of Hawai‘i. The concept of  
setting aside one percent of construction appropriations to provide a funding base for  
the acquisition of works of art set a national standard in 1967 when Hawai‘i became the first state in the nation to pass such legislation. The 1989 revision of the law created the 
Works of Art Special Fund, a non-lapsing account into which all funds set aside for works 
of art are deposited and from which expenditures for purposes consistent with Section 
103-8.5, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, are made.
The Works of Art Special Fund shall be used solely for the following purposes: 
1.C osts related to the acquisition of works of art, including any consultant or staff
servic es required to carry out the art in public places and relocatable works of
art  programs;
2.Sit e modifications, display, and interpretive work necessary for the exhibition of
w orks of art;
3.U pkeep services, including maintenance, repair, and restoration of works of art;
4.S toring and transporting works of art.
APPENDIX A |  292022 Annual ReportFISCAL YEAR 2022 ART IN PUBLIC 
PLACES (APP) COLLECTION PURCHASES AND GIFTS
The APP Program acquires works of art and commissions 
artists to create works of art for specific locations. These works of art are displayed in over 500 sites statewide.
60 artworks from 15 exhibits and venues were purchased 
this year. Works of art are purchased through a community process where an Acquisition Award Selection Committee (AASC) is convened to select works of art for purchase from public galleries, studios of master artists, gifts, and other approved sources. The AASC follows selection criteria to recommend artwork to the SFCA Board of Commissioners for approval to purchase. This year, AASC’s visited 20 exhibits, reviewed 10 gifts, and recommended 65 artworks for purchase (note: the number of nominations and purchases differ as the purchase date of an artwork may be in a different fiscal year than the nomination). To learn more about how exhibit organizers can invite an AASC to an exhibit, please visit the SFCA website at SFCA.Hawaii.gov/art-in-public-places-program/invite-committee .ARTISTS OF RELOCATABLE WORKS

APPENDIX B |  332022 Annual ReportARTISTS IN THE SCHOOLS (AITS) 
CONTRACTS
All public and charter schools in the state can apply 
annually for a Pre-K–12 arts residency grant. Schools are required to use an artist from the SFCA Artistic Teaching Partners Roster. Most elementary schools do not have arts specialists despite the arts being considered a core subject, so most of the applications serve elementary grades. AITS offers residencies in dance, drama, music, literary arts, and visual arts. Under the SFCA, over 12,000 children and 500 teachers in approximately 100 schools are serviced statewide on 6 islands.
97 school grant applications were received, reviewed, 
and awarded grants this year. Applications are reviewed by a Grant Review Panel of individuals with a deep understanding of arts education and who reside on different islands. Panelists are volunteers and do not receive compensation.
The AITS program follows Hawai‘i Administrative Rules, 
Chapters 3-92 to 3-93 concerning panel and application administration.
The Hawai‘i Community Foundation (HCF) has contributed 
matching funds since 2008 with direct funding to the Artistic Teaching Partner 501(c)(3) organizations that are working with the selected AITS schools.
