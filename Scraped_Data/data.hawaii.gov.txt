Use case driven, technology enabled business capabilities with measurable impacts Create data policies & Standards Establish Policies, procedures and processes to ensures the security, integrity and accuracy of data. Apply to data lifecycle management Apply data standards and polices throughout the data life cycle, while data application tools will support every step in this lifecycle. Create impacts using data applications Create impacts by use case through data insights, recommended actions, automated processes, or generated contents. Process and tool requirements Business use cases and user questions determine data processes and tools to create insights and recommend actions as needed. Business Questions Process & tool requirement Where is our data? Identify data sources to facilitate data sharing: Auto detect data sources Real time API preferred vs batch load What data do we have and who owns it? Catalog data sets to provide transparency: Auto detect data set & data elements Dynamic data catalog with real time update Dynamic identification of data set owners Which data has what access restriction? Data access control clearly defined by data stewards: Define & enforce data classification Define table/column/field level access How to manage data quality? Systematically detect/correct data quality: Auto detect quality issues with AI-enabled recommended change for human approval Quality tagging & reporting of data sets How to secure data privacy? Tag and mask data elements for security and privacy: Row/Column/Field level security Data masking rules with auto masking How to request access to certain data? Automatically manage data ownership: Workflow to request/approve data sharing Ability to select row/column field for access Shared data controlled by data owner How to connect data for inter-operability? Enterprise Master Data Management: Create state-wide master identification linking to each department records AI enabled auto matching How to relate data to map locations? Enterprise geospatial data platform: Geocoding, Spatial analysis Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing How to safely & effectively share data? Central platform for all shared data functions: Data engineering, data model, data science (AI/ML), data visualization capabilities Data owner control access Where to publish data after analysis? External & internal portals for data publishing: Automatic, real-time publishing Auto workflow to review/remove/mask sensitive information 1.- Consider existing identity Access Management in solutioning 2.- Consider integration with myHawaii ID in solutioning Background ACT167 : ‘The legislature finds that it is in the State’s interest to increase access to data maintained by and available from state agencies, as such data can inform public policy, stimulate innovation within and outside government, encourage public engagement, and enhance transparency. This data can also spur economic development and produce new and innovative resources and services that benefit state employees, individual citizens, and businesses. The efficient integration, management, governance, and sharing of data can greatly improve state programs and the delivery of services to the State’s citizens. Therefore, unless expressly prohibited by law or regulation, it is vitally important that data held by state agencies be made readily available to other state agencies with a minimum of administrative obstacles so that data shared across agencies contributes to the effective, efficient, and transparent delivery of information resources and services. It is equally vital that state agencies make reasonable efforts to provide public access to this data, unless expressly prohibited by law or regulation.’ ‘The purpose of this Act is to establish within the office of enterprise technology services a chief data officer and a data task force to develop, implement, and manage statewide data policies, procedures, and standards.’ ACT 167 section 27-44 : ‘The Chief Data Officer shall use the state information assets and analytics to research and recommend processes and tools to improve inter-departmental and intra-departmental decision making and reporting.’ Footer Content CONTACT State Data Office HAWAII.GOV Government Directory Online Services Social Media State Calendar Alerts An official website of the State of Hawaiʻi Terms of Use Accessibility Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 , State of Hawaiʻi.
