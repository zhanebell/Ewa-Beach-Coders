The Department of Health and the Hawaii Public Health Institute conducted research under the CHOICES Learning Collaborative Partnership at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and impacts of a state sugary drink fee. This research found that a fee on sugary drinks could help curb Hawai‘i’s obesity and chronic disease epidemic, reduce health care costs, and create revenue that could be reinvested to support the health of Hawai‘i’s keiki and communities.

insulin resistance.13TYPE 2 DIABETES
Sugar in sugary drinks cause the bacteria in 
the mouth to form an acid that sticks on teeth 
causing dental problems such as cavities, 
erosion, gum disease, and bad breath.16 Tooth
