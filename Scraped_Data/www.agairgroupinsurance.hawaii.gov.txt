CJGr[1 Circuit Court, First Circuit Document ID: 435555_.I_JAS 
This matter came on for hearing on May 29, 2008 before the Honorable Glenn J. Kim. In 
accordance with the provisions of Hawaii Revised Statutes (Haw. Rev. Stat.) §§ 431: 15-305(a) 
and 15-306, Petitioner J.P. SCHMIDT, the Insurance Commissioner for the State of Hawaii, 
("Commissioner", "Petitioner", or "Rehabilitator") in his capacity as the Insurance 
Commissioner of the State of Hawaii petitioned this Court for the entry of an Order of 
Liquidation of Respondent AG AfRGROUP INSURANCE, INC. ("Respondent AG Airgroup" or 
"AG Airgroup"). Clifford K. Higa and Joseph A. Stewart appeared on behalf of Petitioner. 
Respondent AG Airgroup, as well as the individual directors of Respondent AG Airgroup, having 
previously filed a statement of no opposition to the Petition for liquidation, did not appear at the 
hearing. In accordance with the pleadings and papers filed herein, the Court finds as follows: 
I. Findings 
l. Jurisdiction and venue of these proceedings is properly in the Circuit Court of the 
First Judicial Circuit under the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat., § 431: l 5-306. 
2. The Court finds that Respondent AG Airgroup is insolvent as that term is defined 
under the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat.§ 431:15-103(a). 
3. The Court finds that Respondent AG Airgroup is in such condition that the further 
transaction of business would be hazardous financially, to its policyholders, creditors or the 
public. 
4. Based on the record, the Court finds that rehabilitation efforts would be futile and 
would substantially increase the risk of loss to Respondent AG Airgroup's creditors, its 
policyholders or the public and would serve no useful purpose. 
5. The Court finds that the grounds for the issuance of an Order of Liquidation 
under the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 43l:15-305(a) and 15-306 have been met and that an 
2 Document JD: 435555 _l _JAS 
Order appointing the Commissioner as the Liquidator and directing the Commissioner to 
forthwith take possession of the assets of Respondent AG Airgroup and to administer them in 
accordance with the provisions of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 431: 15-307 shall be entered. 
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND 
DECREED AS FOLLOWS: 
I. Appointment and Order of Liquidation. The Commissioner is hereby appointed 
Liquidator of Respondent AG Airgroup. Until further order of the Court, the Liquidator, 
including his authorized agents and representatives, is hereby authorized and directed to take 
possession and control of all of the assets, real and personal property, books, accounts, 
documents, and other records (collectively, "Property") of Respondent AG Airgroup and of the 
premises occupied by AG Airgroup or its agents and affiliates for the transaction of business. 
2. This Order of Liquidation applies to, but is not limited, to any and all of Respondent 
AG Airgroup's Property held in various financial institutions. 
2. Recording of Order and Title to Property. In accordance with the provisions 
of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 431: l 5-307(a), the filing or recording of this order with the Clerk of the 
Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit or at the Bureau of Conveyances shall impart the same 
notice as evidence of title. The Order to liquidate Respondent AG Airgroup shall by operation of 
law vest title to all assets of Respondent AG Airgroup in the Liquidator. Title to all property, 
contracts, and rights of action and all of the books and records of Respondent AG Airgroup, 
wherever located, shall vest by operation oflaw in the Commissioner, as Liquidator, as of the 
date of the entry of this Order of Liquidation. 
3. Permanent Injunction and Automatic Stay. In accordance with the provisions 
of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 431: 15-313, no action at law or equity shall be brought against the insurer 
3 Document ID: 435555_!_JAS 
or liquidator, whether in this State or elsewhere, nor shall any such existing actions be 
maintained or further presented after issuance of such order. The courts of this State shall give 
full faith and credit to injunctions against the liquidator or the company or the continuation of 
existing actions against the liquidator or the company, when such injunctions are included in an 
order to liquidate an insurer issued pursuant to corresponding provisions in other states. 
Whenever in the liquidator's judgment, protection of the estate of the insurer necessitates 
intervention in an action against the insurer that is pending outside this State, the liquidator may 
intervene in the action. The liquidator may defend any action in which the liquidator intervenes 
under this section at the expense of the estate of the insurer. 
In addition, the liquidator may, upon or after an order for liquidation, within two years 
or such time in addition to two years as applicable law may permit, institute an action or 
proceeding on behalf of the estate of the insurer upon any cause of action against which the 
period of limitation fixed by applicable law has not expired at the time of the filing of the 
petition upon which such order is entered. Where, by any agreement, a period of limitation is 
fixed for instituting a suit or proceeding upon any claim, or for filing any claim, proof of claim, 
proof of loss, demand, notice, or the like, or where in any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, a 
period of limitation is fixed, either in the proceeding or by applicable law, for taking any action, 
filing any claim or pleading, or doing any act, and where in any such case the period had not 
expired at the date of the filing of the petition, the liquidator, may, for the benefit of the estate, 
take any such action or do any such act, required of or permitted to the insurer, within a period of 
I 80 days subsequent to the entry of an order for liquidation, or within such further period as is 
shown to the satisfaction of the court not to be unfairly prejudicial to the other party. 
4 Document ID: 435555_J_JAS

following activities by or on behalf of AG Airgroup without the prior written approval of the

NOTICE OF LIQUIDATION ORDER AND PROCEDURES FOR FILING CLAIMS IN 
THE AG AIRGROUP INSURANCE COMPANY LIQUIDATION 
IMPORTANT NOTICE 
YOUR CLAIM RESPONSE FORM MUST BE RECEIVED BY WITH THE 
LIQUIDATOR NO LATER THAN DECEMBERS, 2008 OR YOU MAY BE BARRED 
FROM ANY MONETARY DISTRIBUTION FROM THE ESTATE 
AUGUST 8, 2008 
Re: J.P. Schmidt vs. AG Airgroup Insurance. Inc.: S.P. No. 08-1-188 (GJK) 
To All Insurance Commissioners and All Agents, Policyholders and Potential Claimants of 
AG Airgroup Insurance, Inc. and of any Affiliates: 
Pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat.,§ 431:15-311, you are hereby provided with the following 
notice. AG Airgroup Insurance, Inc. ("AG Airgroup") was licensed by the State of Hawaii 
Insurance Division as a captive insurance company. AG Airgroup provided workers' 
compensation insurance coverage to Aloha Airgroup, Inc. and its affiliates, including Aloha 
Airlines, Inc., as well as surety bond coverage for Aloha Airgroup, Inc. as to various airport 
leases. 
On May 29, 2008, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawaii, issued an Order 
of Liquidation of AG Airgroup. The court declared AG Airgroup insolvent as defined in the 
Hawaii Liquidation Act. The court further appointed the Insurance Commissioner of the State of 
Hawaii, J.P. Schmidt, and his successors in office, as Liquidator and ordered him to take 
possession and title of all of AG Airgroup's assets and liquidate AG Airgroup in accordance with 
the Hawaii Liquidation Act under the general supervision of the court. 
Information concerning the liquidation of AG Airgroup, as well as a copy of the 
Liquidation Order, may be obtained from the Hawaii Insurance Division's website noted above. 
Pursuant to the Liquidation Order, all insurance policies insured by AG Airgroup are ordered 
cancelled the earlier of: (I) a period of thirty days from the date of the entry of the Liquidation 
Order; (2) the expiration of the policy; or (3) the date when the policy holder has replaced the 
policy with an equivalent policy or otherwise terminated the policy. In addition to the foregoing, enclosed with this Notice is a Claim Response Form and 
Instructions on completing the form. Please read the Instructions carefully and complete the 
Claim Response Form. You will also be required to provide the Liquidator with documentation 
to support your claim. Keep a copy of the all documents submitted to the Liquidator for your 
files. Please be aware that all Claim Response Forms along with all suppotiing documents must 
be received by the Liquidator no later than December 5, 2008. If you fail to file your Claim 
Response Form with all supp011ing documents with the Liquidator by the stated deadline, you 
may be forever barred from receiving any monetary distribution for your claim from the AG 
Airgroup Estate. 
EVEN IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTACTED THE LIQUIDATOR'S 
OFFICE OR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT YOU 
HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED A CLAIM, THE LIQUIDATOR MUST RECEIVE 
YOUR ENCLOSED CLAIM RESPONSE FORM WITH ALL SUPPORTING 
DOCUMENTS BY THE STATED DEADLINE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE AG AIRGROUP EST ATE. 
Pursuant to I-law. Rev. Stat.,§ 43 l:I5-329(b), if your claim is denied by the Liquidator, 
in whole or in part, you will be issued a Notice of Determination informing you of the denial and 
will be given an opportunity to object to the Liquidator's determination within 60 days from the 
mailing of the Notice of Determination, if you fail to object to the Liquidator's Notice of 
Determination, you may not further object. If an objection is timely filed, and the Liquidator's 
Determination is not altered, the Liquidator may request that the court decide the matter or 
appoint a referee to decide the matter. 
At the moment, AG Airgroup does not possess sufficient assets to pay all of the 
anticipated claims. Any additional monies to pay claims will have to come from available 
insurance policies and/or lawsuits I settlements with other individuals or entities. Because 
litigation is time-consuming and uncertain, the Liquidator cannot predict what assets will be 
available to pay claims. Therefore, the Liquidator cannot, at this point, make any assurances as 
to when or how much of a distribution will be made to any claimant. 
Because you are not a named party in the above-referenced liquidation but only a 
potential claimant, various motions, papers, notices and other documents filed in the liquidation 
proceedings are not required to be served on you under Hawaii's Liquidation Act. In light of the 
substantial number of potential claimants, the costs of providing copies of various comi 
documents to each claimant will significantly deplete AG Airgroup's remaining assets. Despite 
this, the Liquidator recognizes that certain developments in the liquidation may be of interest to 
claimants. As a result, the Liquidator, at his sole discretion, may provide you with notice of a 
filed pleading in the liquidation in one of the following manners: (1) by posting a Notice of 
Filed Pleading on the AG Airgroup Estate website: www.AGAirgroupinsurance.hawaii.gov; 
(2) by transmitting the Notice of Filed Pleading via email; OR (3) by U.S. First Class Mail. The 
Liquidator's Notice of Filed Pleading will provide you with a summary of the filed document 
and permit you an opportunity to receive a copy of the document and voice your position, if any. 
Therefore, it is impo11ant for you to often check the AG Airgroup website for any updates. 
2 However, if a particular document filed in the liquidation pertains to you specifically, as 
opposed to a class of claimants generally, you will be provided with notice and service of that 
particular document. 
The Liquidator appreciates your patience as the liquidation process may take several 
years to conclude. Above all, the Liquidator and his staff will do everything possible to insure 
that all those affected by the liquidation of AG Airgroup will be treated fairly and equally in 
accordance with the Hawaii Liquidation Act.
