appropriate steps to assure that each department and agency acts to curb protected 
class discrimination or harassment without regard to its severity or pervasiveness and 
does not require that discrimination or harassment rise to the level of unlawfulness 
before taking action. 
The Department of Human Resources Development ("DHRD") is responsible for 
maintaining the Equal Employment Opportunity Program ("EEO Program") for the State 
Executive branch departments (excluding the Department of Education and the 
University of Hawaii Board of Regents appointees). The EEO Program will provide 
guidance to departments and agencies in order to assure and maintain a workplace 
free of discrimination, harassment and retaliation in personnel practices, including 
recruitment, hiring, work assignments, training, reasonable accommodations, 
compensation, benefits, evaluations, promotions, demotions, discipline, and 
termination. 
In order to achieve the State's goal of a discrimination/harassment/retaliation-free 
workplace, the EEO Program has implemented the Discrimination/Harassment Free-
Workplace Policy, Policy & Procedure 601.001. The EEO Program will be responsible 
for developing and providing mandatory training on this policy for all employees, both 
supervisors and non-supervisors. The schedule for this mandatory training will be 
determined by DHRD. The EEO Program will provide additional non-mandatory EEO 
training periodically as the need is determined by DHRD. 
The department and agency heads shall continue their responsibility to ensure equal 
opportunity in employment. Each department shall designate an EEO 
coordinator/liaison to work with DHRD's EEO Program.
