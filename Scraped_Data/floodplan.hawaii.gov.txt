§179-1  Declaration of purpose.   It is declared: 
     (1)  That floods caused by heavy rainstorms and abnormal tidal action 
are detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of 
the people of the State, resulting in jeopardy to and the loss 
of life and property, disruption of commerce, and interruption 
of transportation and communications; that the reduction of 
flood damage is therefore of primary importance to the people of the State; and the conservation and beneficial use of flood 
water is an essential adjunct to rainfall drainage and flood 
control. 
     (2)  It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the 
coordination by the State of all federal and state flood control 
projects undertaken in Hawaii and for such technical or 
financial assistance to its political subdivisions as may be desirable or necessary to assure maximum benefits to the people 
of the State from the expenditure of state funds for flood 
control purposes. 
     (3)  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any political subdivision 
through its proper officials from requesting federal aid on its 
own initiative and at its own expense without having to secure 
state approval. [L 1961, c 34, §1; am L 1963, c 148, pt of §1;

This User's Manual is a technical communication document to assist 
in the navigation of the SGFCP Website and its content. This manual provides background information on the purpose and goals of the website, disclaimers associated with the website's data and content, and instructions on how the website should be accessed, utilized, and maintained. This manual also includes instructions on the use of the many tools designed for, and found, on the website. The SGFCP Website is funded through a State of Hawaii initiative in direct support of HRS 179.  This legislation's primary goal is to enable the coordination and management of flood waters to conserve water resources and prevent and/or mitigate the impact of flood events.  The SGFCP website was developed to directly support this goal. The intent and purpose of this website is to provide support for flood-related events and activities.  
The SGFCP Website contains data and information from a wide variety of 
federal, state, and local resources and is meant to serve as a repository of flood-related information for the State of Hawaii. The SGFCP website provides an important platform for sharing flood-related information between the HI-DLNR, its inter-agency and non-governmental stakeholders and the general public.  It is important to note that much of the data (including GIS map data) and many of the reports in the document library are provided from sources other than the HI-DLNR.  The HI-DLNR (or SGFCP website) does not have "control" over this information, nor do they have the ability to make adjustments or correcting errors in documents or GIS map data layers.  The HI-DLNR will review documents and map-based flood report locations prior to releasing the any of the content to the public-facing website.  Inquiries about documents or data used on the SGFCP website should be directed to the authoring agency or data source.  This information can be found in the document library or the Metadata section on the SGFCP Website contact page.

 REPORT A FLOOD EVENT (HAWAII ONLY) - provides Users with a tool to navigate to location and add a point location for an on-going or recent flood-related event.
 LOCATE HAWAII PROPERTY FLOOD INFORMATION - provides a tool for searching for specific locations or property (Hawaii only) and provides a listing of flood-related information related to that property (e.g., FEMA flood zone and tsunami hazard zone information ).
 LEARN ABOUT WATERSHEDS AND FLOOD REPORTS - provides a tool for selecting areas on the map and determining basic watershed and hydrological information, USGS stream gage data, and available flood reports (from the SGFCP Document Library) for the selected location.
5. MAP TOOLS  
Navigating the Map Tools Webpage
Page Navigation Tools
The Map Tools page consists of a map view window and several 
docked panels, toolbars, and navigation and display control features. By default, the map view window opens at the maximum extent of data (main Hawaiian Islands) and displays the SGFCP Base Map (color-shaded elevations) and current NOAA weather satellite feed data. Zoom in and out of the map by using the +/- buttons in the upper-right corner of the map view window, or by using your computer mouse wheel/scroll function with the cursor on the map. The "Home" button located just below the +/- buttons will return your map back to the default view. On the left and right sides of the map view window, the arrow tabs allow for the opening and closing of the Map Tool Panel and Map Legend Panel. These may be individually collapsed to provide more space for viewing the map and information. A Quick Links Toolbar at the top of the page provides access to other pages of the SGFCP website, such as the home page and Document Library.
PUBLIC USER'S MANUAL
5Map Tools Panel
The Map Tools Panel is located on the right side of the Map Tools 
Webpage. It can be opened and closed using the arrow tab in the map view window.  The top of the panel includes three controls: Two controls that toggle between the Tools Panel and the "Choose Your Map Layers" panel, and a "Reset" control.  The third control is used to reset the map view and data layers back to the default extent shown when the Map Tools webpage is first accessed.Map Tools Webpage
5. MAP TOOLS  
Map Tools Panel
Map navigation tools are provided in the upper right corner of the map view window.  These allow for zooming in and out, or returning home to the full map extent.  An identification tool is also provided allowing the user to query certain map features, such as current weather alert information. Note that these tools may be hidden from view when the Map Legend Panel is opened. Click on the arrow tab to close the legend panel and access the navigation tools.
The Map Tools Panel includes the three SGFCP Map Tools (REPORT, 
LOCATE, LEARN), as well as a Settings menu.  The Settings menu allows you to select from a variety of base maps including the SGFCP default (colored-shaded elevations), imagery, street maps, and others. Only one base map can be selected at a time, but you may toggle between base maps used in the map view window at any time.  The Settings menu also contains a Set Base Map Transparency that will adjust the opacity of the base map selected. This can be helpful when reviewing numerous data layers simultaneously. The three SGFCP Map Tools are discussed in greater detail below.
PUBLIC USER'S MANUAL
6Map Layers Panel 
The Map Layers Panel lists available 
data layers that can be turned on and off in the map view window.  Data layers can be turned on and off by checking and unchecking the box to the left of each data layer name.  Data layers are organized by source (e.g., NFHL is the National Flood Hazard Layer provided by FEMA) or type (e.g., water resources, terrestrial, parcels and zoning).  Some type 
groups include multiple available data layers that can be accessed by clicking on the "+" sign to the left of the type group name. A transparency slider bar is provided at the group level to adjust the opacity of the layers in the group.  This can be useful when working with multiple overlapping layers or with an imagery base map.
In the Map Layers Panel, scrolling 
over the data layer name will pop-up 
a reference legend for that data layer, showing how it is displayed in the map view window.  Additionally, as map layers are turned on and off, the Map Legend Panel (docked on the right side of the page) will update to show all layers currently turned on.
NOTE:  In order to improve the website map display performance, available data layers have been set to display only at certain extents.  Certain data layers will only displayed when zoomed in to a small display area (e.g., parcel lines).  If a data layer was turned on but does not appear on the map view window, try zooming in to a smaller area. It should also appear in the Map Legend Panel. As previously discussed, the selected Base Map (under the Settings menu) will always draw at all scales. However, only one Base Map can be selected at a time.
Map Legend Panel
The Map Legend Panel is accessed using the arrow tab on the right side of the map view window. It can be toggled on/off by clicking on the arrow tab.  This panel shows the legend for all data layers currently visible in the map view window. If a data layer is constrained to only draw at certain extents, it will not show on map or be listed in the Map Legend Panel (see note above).  
Use the scroll bar on the right side of 
the panel allows you to scroll down to see all selected map layers on the map. The Map Legend Panel does not contain a legend for any Base Map Layers (from the Settings Menu),

75.1 REPORT A FLOOD EVENT TOOL (HAWAII ONLY)
The REPORT Tool allows Users to add a point location on the map for 
an on-going or recent observed flood-related event.  This may be used to indicate impacts to public or private property caused by floods, or to indicate locations that pose a flood risk, such as a culvert under repair or a road wash-out.
This tool is only available for locations in Hawaii (extent of the Map Area) 
and does NOT constitute a formal filing of a flood impact for disaster assistance or mitigation. To initiate the disaster assistance process, Users wishing to formally file a flood event should contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and use their Disaster Report App at:
https://www.fema.gov/disaster-reporter  Flood event locations and information entered using the REPORT tool will 
be reviewed by website administrators for quality control purposes. Public Users can use the tool to indicate the location and type of flood event and attach photos to the point location. Information gathered through this process can be used by HI-DLNR staff to track and report on a number of flood conditions and flood related activities, including:
 Identification of reoccurring flood-prone areas
 Identification of reoccurring flood-prone areas
 Flood damage to public or private property
 Flood damage to roads, culverts, drainages, or dams
 Flood event risks such as road washouts, rock falls, or downed power lines
The HI-DLNR Engineering Division (SGFCP Website Administrators) has additional tools in the REPORT tool that will allow them to add locations for flood mitigation activities. This allows the HI-DLNR to keep the public informed on HI-DLNR construction projects or other ongoing or scheduled activities. During active emergency flood events (e.g., hurricanes, tsunamis, flash floods), the REPORT tool can be used by the Website Administrators to share information with other federal and state agencies and the public by helping to identify locations of flood-impacted areas to support decision-making during flood events. To that end, it should be noted that the SGFCP website is a "flood support" tool, not an emergency management tool. During any flood or natural disaster event, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HIEMA) should be the official source for all disaster and emergency response information. Website links to both agencies are on the SGFCP Partners/Funds page.
To Report a Flood Event:
1. Go to Report A Flood Event in the Map Tools Panel.
2. Type an address in the search bar, or zoom into an area on the map.
3. Click on the icon shown under the "Report Flood Event" and then select 
a point on the map.
4. A "Reported Event" window appears:
a. Select the Event Type description that applies best.
b. Enter the Start and End Dates of the flood. If unknown, leave 
blank.
c. Check "Have you contacted FEMA?" if you have contacted FEMA 
about the event.
d. Add notes in the Comments box (e.g., description of location, type 
of damage).
e. If desired, include an attachment (e.g., photo) with the report; the 
maximum file size for attachments is 2 GB.
f. To save and submit the report, click Save. To remove the point, 
click Close. (Note: A reported event cannot be edited after it is saved/submitted.)5. MAP TOOLS  PUBLIC USER'S MANUAL
8The LOCATE tool allows Users to obtain flood-related information on a 
property of interest. This tools allows the User to look up a location by address 
(indicated by the red marker icon) or by clicking on a point on the map (blue marker icon). The tool queries the underlying flood data and returns the query results in the dialogue box. This information can then be printed electronically in an auto-generated PDF report that includes the query results and screen-capture of the map view window. (Note: You must have Adobe Reader installed for the report generation feature. It can be downloaded for free at:  https://get.adobe.com/reader/ ).  This informational tool can be used by a 
property owner to better understand their flood risks or by floodplain managers 
or planners to gather information and conduct preliminary evaluations on an area of interest.
To Locate a Property:

5.2 LOCATE HAWAII PROPERTY FLOOD INFORMATION TOOLPUBLIC USER'S MANUAL
9The LEARN Tool allows Users to learn more about the very unique 
Hawaiian Islands Watersheds and other hydrological systems.  Unlike U.S. mainland states, Hawaii's isolation in the western Pacific Ocean means that it is solely reliant on its own aquifers and watersheds for its freshwater resources. Like a drop of oil in a pool of salt water, each island has a freshwater lens that resides in the spaces between the island surface above and the salt water attempting its way in on all sides. This aquifer lens is maintained by the collection of rainfall on the mauka (upland) Hawaiian mountains and volcanoes and in rivers and streams flowing makai (seaward). Watersheds are a delineation of the topographical surface that feeds the river and streams as they make their way downward to the sea. Major watersheds may be further subdivided to (sub) watersheds or small units (such as drainages), but all watersheds typically feed the same outflow river and stream system. This system of aquifers, watersheds, rivers and streams are a critical resource for the residents of Hawaii. The LEARN Tool provides an interactive map environment for learning about and understanding the relationships between these hydrological systems and potential impacts from both inland and coastal flood events.
The LEARN Tool starts at the full extent of the SGFCP map area showing 
the SGFCP Website (color shaded elevation) Base Map (recommended to start).  Because each Hawaiian Island is a self-contained hydrological system, start by selecting an island from the "Navigate To" drop-down menu. This will take you to that island's map extent and turn on the Aquifer (lavender lines) and Major Watersheds (blue-white dashed line) for the selected island.  Additionally, the USGS stream monitoring gages are included.  By scrolling over the stream gage locations, a dialogue box will appear where you can access current stream monitoring data and reports as well as historical records for that stream gage.
You can continue to drill down to the watershed and stream levels, where more detailed hydrological and other information will appear on the map. You may consider changing the Base Map when viewing at a small-scale area for easier viewing.  As shown below, the parcel lines and detailed hydrological systems have automatically turned on in the map and have been added to the Map Legend.  You may also access the Map Layer panel to turn on/off other available data layers.
In addition to this drill down navigation feature, you can also jump directly to a specific watershed or stream by selecting it from the drop-down list.  As was previously mentioned, some data layers are limited to draw only at certain scales.  You can activate them (make visible) by using the zoom-in button in the map view window or the computer mouse wheel/scroll function while the cursor is on the map.
At any time or map scale, you can click on the map and perform a query.  
The query will select the underlying (sub) watershed and display the Query Results in the Map Tools Panel. The selected watershed will be highlighted in red on the map.5. MAP TOOLS

The Query Results return a listing of the pertinent aquifers, watersheds, 
and associated streams for the selected (sub) watershed. Click on a results name (e.g., Major Watershed = South Kona), then click on "Show Attributes" for a pop-up box with additional information and any available flood reports and documents (located in the SGFCP Document Library) for the selected area. You can also print the results of the query using the "Print" option at the bottom of the Attributes pop-up box. Click on "Clear Results" to de select the selected items and reset the query dialogue.
Another alternative for running the query is by selecting an option in the "Query Map By" drop-down list. One option is to select by a 1000 ft. buffer area. This could be useful for areas that straddle two or more watersheds or for working at a smaller scale. Once again, click on the query results to bring up the Attributes pop-up box that contains information and links to available reports and documents.  
Note: The LEARN tool is intended to query only the identified flood layers, and reports are linked at the (sub) watershed level.  While you can add and remove other data from the Data Layers panel, the LEARN Tool is not designed to perform queries on other data shown in the map view window.
Quick Steps:
1. Use the drop-down menus to select a view/extent in the desired area: 
Island, Watershed, and/or Stream. 
2. Use the "Query Map By" function to set a buffer distance for the search.  
3. Click the area/location/feature of interest on the map to initiate the 
query. The Query Results will appear in the sidebar. 
4. For more details, click on any of the available links provided next to 
certain fields under the Query Results (e.g., Major Watershed, Aquifer). To find a list of flood-related public reports associated with the designated location's watershed, click anywhere on the map or on the link shown in the "Major Watershed" field, then click on the "Show Attributes" link shown in the pop-up window that appears.
5. Click the "Print" button at the bottom of the sidebar to print the results. 6. Click on "Clear Results" in the sidebar to clear the results and perform 
a new search.
