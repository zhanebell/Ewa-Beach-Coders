Hawai’i State Ethics Commission 1001 Bishop St. #970 Honolulu, HI 96813 (808) 587-0460  ethics.hawaii.gov  info.ethics@hawaii.gov2023 ANNUAL REPORT
HAWAI’I STATE ETHICS COMMISSION 2023 ANNUAL REPORT MISSION & DUTIES: 
Established in 1968, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission – the first state ethics commission in the United States – represents a commitment by the people of Hawai‘i to the principles that “public officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethical conduct[,] and that these standards come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.” Hawai‘i Constitution, article XIV. The constitution further requires that the State, and each of its subdivisions, establish a code of ethics for public officers and employees. Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, the Commission is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law, chapters 84 and 97, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”), respectively. The Ethics Code includes laws relating to the acceptance and reporting of gifts, confidential information, fair treatment (the prohibited misuse of official position), conflicts of interests, state contracts, and post-employment restrictions, along with a requirement that state legislators, candidates for state elective office, and certain state employees file financial disclosure statements.   For purposes of the State Ethics Code, the Commission has jurisdiction over approximately 60,000 state officials and employees. This includes state legislators and other elected state officials, employees of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (except for judges and justices), and members of all state boards and commissions. The State Ethics Code’s financial disclosure law also applies to all candidates for state elective office.   The Commission also administers the State Lobbyists Law, which applies to lobbying activities at the state level. The Lobbyists Law requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and requires lobbyists and organizations that lobby

ETHICS ADVICE: The Commission issues advisory opinions and other types of guidance (including opinion letters written by the Commission’s attorneys) about the application of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law. In 2023, the Commission’s attorneys received and responded to an impressive 1,179 requests for advice from state legislators, state employees, lobbyists, members of the public, and candidates for state elective office. Many of these requests included written advice and active follow-up. The Commission considers its ability to provide timely and meaningful guidance and advice to be one of its most essential functions.   In 2023, no advisory opinions were issued.  ETHICS EDUCATION: Ethics education was a significant priority for the Commission in 2023. The Commission is charged with educating state officials and employees about ethics in government, HRS § 84-31(a)(7). Starting on January 1, 2023, a new law required all state employees to take either a live or online ethics training course within ninety days of becoming an employee and at least once every four years thereafter.  Fulfilling this new mandate was a key focus of the Commission. Implementation steps included conducting in-person and videoconference trainings. In addition to INFO.ETHICS@HAWAII.GOV (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOV
NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AWARD The Commission’s education efforts received recognition from the Campaign Legal Center’s 2023 “Top 10 Training Upgrades for Ethics Commissions” report. Available at https://campaignlegal.org/PAGE   3
oﬀering general ethics trainings, the Commission scheduled specialized trainings for lobbyists, board & commission members, and legislators. The Commission also oﬀered sessions with Continuing Legal Education credits for government attorneys. The Commission’s videoconference training calendar can be found at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/training/#signup. Key to meeting the mandatory ethics training requirement was a shift towards a self-directed online training modules. These training modules empower state employees to engage in ethics education anytime, anywhere, provided they have a computer and internet access. Three modules were oﬀered in 2023:

PAGE   4• State employees; •Board and commission members; and •Charter schools. Designed for convenience, these on-demand training sessions require approximately 35 minutes to complete. They oﬀer a user-friendly and adaptable method for state employees to fulfill their ethics training requirements. For direct access, individuals can visit the Commission’s dedicated webpage: https://ethics.hawaii.gov/training/. With assistance from a variety of government agencies, a monumental total of 35,977 participants undertook the self-directed training module in 2023. It should be noted this represents approximately 500% increase in the number of participants over 2022, and a dramatic 7,724% increase over 2021. While difficult to track with specificity, it appears approximately 70% of all state employees met the mandatory ethics training requirement by the end of 2023. These incredible numbers were achieved without any direct increase in budget or staffing of the Commission.  LEGISLATION: In 2023, the Commission, through its Executive Director, actively participated in the Commission to Improve Standards of Conduct, an entity created by the State House of Representatives. Approximately 10 ethics-related policy proposals were drafted, considered, and recommended by the Standards Commissions for consideration by the 2023 Legislature. The Ethics Commission successfully advocated for many of these bills to pass or to be included in Legislative rules. Ethics bills that passed in 2023 included:

Imposes administrative fines for violations.  The Ethics Commission is committed to implementing these new laws. Recognizing the complexity of these initiatives, the Commission has prioritized the establishment of a robust rollout of guidance, back office support, and online filing changes to ensure a seamless rollout.  ENFORCEMENT: The Commission enforces the State Ethics Code, HRS chapter 84, and the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97. The Commission receives and reviews complaints and conducts investigations on a confidential basis concerning alleged violations of the law.  When appropriate, the Commission initiates formal charges against individuals who appear to have violated the law. If there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the law has occurred, the Commission may hold a contested case hearing in accordance with HRS chapter 91, Hawaii’s Administrative Procedure Act.

PAGE   7In 2023, the Commission received 329 new complaints of violations of the Ethics Code and Lobbyists Law. The Commission issued 17 Resolutions to Investigate, authorizing staﬀ to conduct comprehensive investigations, issued three Charges, and closed 360 cases. The Commission publicly resolved four Charges and investigations by issuing a Resolution of Investigation/Charge document. The Commission resolved another 8 matters by issuing ethics guidance and closed 349 other matters for lack of jurisdiction, lack of supporting evidence, or another reason. Many of those cases were referred to other government agencies for action. The Commission assessed a total of $9,500 in administrative penalties, payable to the General Fund.  Notable enforcement actions include: Department of Taxation, Ted Shiraishi:  Resolution of Investigation 2023-2 The Commission resolved an Investigation of Ted Shiraishi, former Administrative Rules Officer of the State of Hawai’i Department of Taxation. Mr. Shiraishi was subject to the post-employment provisions of the State Ethics Code, HRS § 84-18. As such, he was prohibited from representing another person or business for one year on any matter involving action by his former state agency. During this restriction period, Mr. Shiraishi called and sent a letter to the DOTAX rules office on behalf of his new private employer to discuss a tax matter. Mr. Shiraishi had not previously been the subject of a Commission charge or investigation. He cooperated with the Commission’s investigation.

Mr. Zakahi provided clerical support for deputy attorney generals. As a part of his duties and responsibilities, Mr. Zakahi sent an electronic message to Plaintiﬀ’s counsel in a particular matter that referenced confidential information that Mr. Zakahi had reviewed as a legal clerk.

He agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $1,000 to the State of Hawai’i.  NEPOTISM EXCEPTIONS As of July 12, 2023 no state employee (except for employees of the legislative or judicial branches) shall “[a]ppoint, hire, promote, or retain a relative or household member to, or demote, discharge, or terminate a relative or household member from . . . a paid position in the employee’s employing agency . . . .” The Commission INFO.ETHICS@HAWAII.GOV (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE   9“may grant an exception to an employee or agency that is unable to comply with this section for good cause, including a demonstrated lack of qualified personnel or applicants.” Act 261 at (g). On May 17, 2023, the Commission delegated “the initial decision on any good cause exception application to the Executive Director.”  A total of five nepotism good cause exception applications were considered in 2023. These decisions are public and can be found on the Commission’s website at https://hawaiiethics.my.site.com/public/s/ethics-advice/Ethics_Advice__c/00B6R00000AwpdxUAB or https://ethics.hawaii.gov/opinionpubs/. FINANCIAL & GIFTS DISCLOSURES The Commission administers the filing requirements of the financial disclosure law and the gifts disclosure law, which help provide accountability and transparency in government. In 2023, the Commission received 1,805 financial disclosure statements. Public disclosure statements (for elected officials, department directors, and other designated state officials) are available on the Commission’s “public data” portion of its website. The Commission received and published 236 gifts disclosure statements, all of which are available on the “public data” portion of the Commission’s website. LOBBYISTS REGISTRATION & EXPENDITURE REPORTS   The Commission administers HRS chapter 97, the Lobbyists Law, which requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and file periodic expenditure reports. In 2019, the Commission launched its new electronic filing system for lobbying registration and reporting, allowing lobbyists to register and file their periodic expenditure reports electronically. The Commission is continually upgrading and improving the e-filing system for lobbying, financial disclosures, and gifts disclosures; the Commission launched a series of enhancements in 2023 to make it easier for filers to complete their forms. 
INFO.ETHICS@HAWAII.GOV (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE   10In 2023, the Commission received and published 523 lobbyist registration statements, representing 448 organizations, along with 1,252 lobbyist expenditure reports. FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE: The Commission partnered with the Department of the Attorney General to launch an anti-fraud hotline aimed at identifying fraud, waste, and abuse of government funds. The agencies developed a website and online complaint form (antifraud.hawaii.gov), dedicated phone hotline (808.587.0000), and dedicated email address (antifraud@hawaii.gov) where individuals can confidentially report suspected violations. These anti-fraud resources were created to empower the public with confidential, easy-to-use methods to report potential violations. OFFICE MODERNIZATION In 2023, the Commission adeptly negotiated a restructuring of its office lease terms, securing a favorable monthly rate reduction. Additionally, an agreement was reached to refurbish the office premises, bearing no supplementary costs for the State of Hawai’i. Having occupied the same office for approximately three decades with minimal updates, this renovation initiative was both timely and necessary. The modernization encompassed enhancements such as upgraded carpeting, installation of energy-efficient lighting, refreshed paintwork, and a reimagined office layout, all designed to optimize both operational efficiency and visual appeal. SCANNING DOCUMENTS In 2023, the Commission successfully completed the digitization of most essential office documents, a critical step towards a paperless initiative. Approximately 75,000 pages were scanned into digital format and then safely shredded. The scanning process not only increased document accessibility and security but also paved the way for streamlined data management. By leveraging advanced optical character recognition (OCR) technology, the Commission can now more efficiently retrieve and share information, contributing to a more productive and eco-friendly work environment. INFO.ETHICS@HAWAII.GOV (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE   11INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION In conjunction with reducing overall paper documentation in the office, the Commission worked to remove obsolete and unnecessary furniture items. With the approval of the Speaker of the House and Senate President, 12 filing cabinets, 9 desks, and 4 chairs were oﬀered to other state agencies, donated to charity, or appropriately discarded. This optimization created more open and functional areas, leading to a more modern and decluttered office space. 2023 ETHICS IN HAWAI’I CONFERENCE The Commission coordinated with the Honolulu Ethics Commission to organize a day-long state-wide Ethics in Hawai’i Conference, drawing participation from each county, totaling 38 attendees. Esteemed speakers, renowned in the fields of ethics and criminal justice, oﬀered an overview of pertinent topics and emerging trends. A key focus was on contemporary ethics scandals in the news, with a discussion on how to better prevent and address corruption at the state and county level.  The conference's agenda encompassed training sessions and fostering skill development among participants. The interactive nature of the discussions facilitated robust engagement, encouraging collaborative learning, and the exchange of best practices. A notable outcome of the event was the strengthened network of relationships between county representatives and state agencies. The collaborative spirit exhibited throughout the conference underscores a collective commitment to advancing ethical standards across Hawai’i. The Ethics in Hawai’i Conference served as a pivotal platform for professional development, knowledge dissemination, and the cultivation of collaborative partnerships, setting a constructive tone for ongoing endeavors to advance ethics on a statewide basis. COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF: The Commission is comprised of five members nominated by the State Judicial Council and appointed by the Governor for four-year terms. The Commission INFO.ETHICS@HAWAII.GOV (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE   12welcomed one new member in 2023. The current members of the Commission are Wesley Fong (Chair), Harry McCarthy (Vice Chair), Beverley Tobias, Robert Hong, and Cynthia Thielen.

2022 ANNUAL REPORT
HAWAI’I STATE ETHICS COMMISSION
1001 Bishop St. #970 Honolulu, HI 96813 (808) 587-0460  www.ethics.hawaii.gov ethics@hawaiiethics.orgPAGE 2Hawai’i State Ethics Commission 2022 ANNUAL REPORT MISSION & DUTIES 
Established in 1968, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission – the first state ethics commission in the United States – represents a commitment by the people of Hawai‘i to the principles that “public officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethical conduct[,] and that these standards come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.” Hawai‘i Constitution, article XIV. The constitution further requires that the State, and each of its subdivisions, establish a code of ethics for public officers and employees. Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, the Commission is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law, chapters 84 and 97, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”), respectively. The Ethics Code includes laws relating to the acceptance and reporting of gifts, confidential information, fair treatment (the prohibited misuse of official position), conflicts of interests, state contracts, and post-employment restrictions, along with a requirement that state legislators, candidates for state elective office, and certain state employees file financial disclosure statements.   For purposes of the State Ethics Code, the Commission has jurisdiction over more than 50,000 state officials and employees. This includes state legislators and other elected state officials, employees of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (except for judges and justices), and members of all state boards and commissions. The State Ethics Code’s financial disclosure law also applies to all candidates for state elective office.   
ETHICS@HAWAIIETHICS.ORG (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOV
PAGE 3The Commission also administers the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97, which applies to lobbying activities at the state level. The Lobbyists Law requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and requires lobbyists and organizations that lobby to report lobbying expenditures and contributions on forms filed with the Commission. The Commission has jurisdiction over nearly 500 lobbyists representing more than 400 organizations that lobby the state legislature or executive branch. ETHICS ADVICE The Commission issues advisory opinions and other types of guidance (including written staﬀ opinion letters by the Commission’s attorneys) about the application of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law. In 2022, the Commission’s attorneys received and responded to 1,129 requests for advice from state legislators, state employees, lobbyists, members of the public, and candidates for state elective office. The Commission considers its ability to provide timely and meaningful guidance and advice to be one of its most essential functions.   In 2022, the Commission issued two formal Advisory Opinions, all of which are available via the Commission’s public data website and on Westlaw, a legal research platform: 1.Advisory Opinion 2022-1, addressed whether a state employee could apply to her own state agency for a license to operate a private business. Because the employee was directly involved in regulating this industry, the Commission concluded that the State Ethic Code prohibited the employee from applying for and obtaining the requested license while being employed by that agency.  2.Advisory Opinion 2022-2, advising whether state employees may own a business and, through that business, procure the services of an Agency research facility. The Commission concluded that the State Ethics Codes does not prohibit this, provided the employees abided by certain restrictions. The Commission provided guidance to avoid potential conflicts of interest and noted the employees could not use their state position to obtain unwarranted advantages or benefits for themselves, their business, or any of its clients.  
ETHICS@HAWAIIETHICS.ORG (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE 4ETHICS EDUCATION The Commission is charged with educating state officials and employees about ethics in government, HRS § 84-31(a)(7). To fulfill this mandate, the Commission conducts in-person and videoconference trainings, and oﬀers self-directed online training modules throughout the year. In 2022, the Commission conducted twenty-seven training sessions via videoconference with a total of 3,157 participants. In addition to oﬀering general ethics trainings, the Commission scheduled several specialized trainings targeted towards lobbyists, board & commission members, and legislators. The Commission also oﬀered two sessions with Continuing Legal Education credits for government attorneys. As a change in 2022, the Commission moved towards a set calendar of trainings. While the Commission will consider requests for tailored agency trainings, the Commission encourages participants to sign up for one of the regularly scheduled trainings. The Commission’s videoconference training calendar can be found at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/training/#signup. The Commission also oﬀers on-demand, on-line training modules for (1) state employees; (2) board and commission members; and (3) charter schools. These on-demand training modules take around 35-minutes to complete and are intended to be a flexible and easy way for state employees to take an ethics training at their convenience. They can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. These modules are available on the Commission’s website at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/ethicsonlinetraining/. A total of

ETHICS EDUCATION MANDATE: Starting on January 1, 2023, all state employees will be required to take either a live or online ethics training course within ninety days of becoming an employee and at least once every four years thereafter. The Commission is meeting this new requirement by, among other things, collaborating with the University of Hawai’i, the Judiciary, and the Department of Human Resources Development to incorporate its on-demand, on-line training modules into their existing on-line training platforms.PAGE 56,042 employees completed an on-demand training module with the Commission in 2022.  Cumulatively, a total of 9,199 individuals were trained by the Commission through its in-person training, web-based training, and videoconference training programs in 2022. LEGISLATION In 2022, the Commission successfully advocated for the passage of Act 165 (H.B. 1475), which mandates ethics training for all State employees. This new law requires state employees to complete a live or online ethics training course within ninety days of becoming an employee and at least once every four years thereafter. Existing employees, if they have not taken an ethics training within three years, must take a new ethics training by January 1, 2024.  In addition, the Commission, through its Executive Director, actively participated in the Commission to Improve Standards of Conduct. Approximately 10 ethics-related policy proposals were drafted, considered, and recommended by the Standards Commissions for consideration by the 2023 Legislature.  ENFORCEMENT The Commission enforces the State Ethics Code, HRS chapter 84, and the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97. The Commission receives and reviews complaints and conducts investigations on a confidential basis concerning alleged violations of the law.  When appropriate, the Commission initiates formal charges against individuals who appear to have violated the law. If there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the law has occurred, the Commission may hold a contested case hearing in accordance with HRS chapter 91, Hawaii’s Administrative Procedure Act.   In 2022, the Commission received 240 new complaints of violations of the Ethics Code and Lobbyists Law. The Commission issued fifteen Resolutions authorizing staﬀ to conduct investigations, issued three Charges, and closed 169 cases. The Commission publicly resolved three Charges and investigations (including those below) by issuing a Resolution of Investigation/Charge document. The Commission resolved another 10 ETHICS@HAWAIIETHICS.ORG (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE 6matters by issuing ethics guidance and closed 140 other matters for lack of jurisdiction, lack of supporting evidence, or another reason. Many of those cases were referred to other government agencies for action. The Commission assessed a total of $2,550 in administrative penalties, payable to the General Fund, in addition to $16,600 in restitution in one matter.  Notable enforcement actions include: Hawai’i State Senate, Senator Jarrett Keohokalole:  Resolution of Investigation 2022-1 The Commission resolved an Investigation of Jarrett Keohokalole, Senator, Hawai’i State Senate. On two occasions, Senator Keohokalole used campaign funds to pay for travel expenses ($894.89 and $303.60, respectively). He later requested, and received, reimbursement from the state for the same expenses. The money was deposited to his personal account instead of reimbursing his campaign account. Similarly, Senator Keohokalole used campaign funds to purchase food for a town hall meeting ($65.55). He also received reimbursement from the state, and those funds were put into his personal account instead of going to his campaign account. The respondent admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law (Haw. Rev. Stat. § 84-13) and agreed to repay the $1,264.05 to the State of Hawai’i and pay an additional administrative penalty of $1,500.  Hawai’i State Senate, Senator Maile Shimabukuro: Resolution of Investigation 2022-2  The Commission resolved an Investigation of Maile Shimabukuro, Senator, Hawai’i State Senate. Senator Shimabukuro participated, in her official capacity, in a parade to celebrate several Nanakuli School student athletic teams. At the event, small goodie bags were passed out that included the name of her campaign committee and contact information for the campaign committee. Senator Shimabukuro did not suggest or direct the placement of these cards, but she accepted responsibility for the occurrence.

FRAUD, WASTE, AND ABUSE The Commission partnered with the Department of the Attorney General to launch an anti- fraud hotline aimed at identifying fraud, waste, and abuse of government funds. The agencies developed a website and online complaint form (antifraud.hawaii.gov), dedicated phone hotline (808.587.0000), and dedicated email address (antifraud@hawaii.gov) where individuals can confidentially report suspected violations. These anti-fraud resources were created to complement the state’s eﬀorts to use CARES Act funds responsibly and empower the public with confidential, easy-to-use methods to report potential violations. COMMISSIONERS AND STAFF The Commission is comprised of five members nominated by the State Judicial Council and appointed by the Governor for four-year terms. The Commission welcomed one new member in 2022. The current members of the Commission are Wesley Fong ETHICS@HAWAIIETHICS.ORG (808) 587-0460WWW.ETHICS.HAWAII.GOVPAGE 9(Chairperson), Reynard Graulty (Vice Chairperson), Harry McCarthy, Beverley Tobias, and Robert Hong.

2021 Annual Report 
     
ethics@hawaiiethics.org • (808) 587-0460 • www.ethics.hawaii.gov 2 Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission Mission & Duties  Established in 1968, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission – the first state ethics commission in the United States – represents a commitment by the people of Hawai‘i to the principles that “public officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethical conduct[,] and that these standards come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.”  Hawai‘i Constitution, article XIV.  The constitution further requires that the State, and each of its subdivisions, establish a code of ethics for public officers and employees.  Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, the Commission is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law, chapters 84 and 97, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”), respectively.  The Ethics Code includes laws relating to the acceptance and reporting of gifts, confidential information, fair treatment (the prohibited misuse of official position), conflicts of interests, state contracts, and post-employment restrictions, along with a requirement that state legislators, candidates for state elective office, and certain state employees file financial disclosure statements.    For purposes of the State Ethics Code, the Commission has jurisdiction over more than 50,000 state officials and employees.  This includes state legislators and other elected state officials, employees of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (except for judges and justices), and members of all state boards and commissions.  The State Ethics Code’s financial disclosure law also applies to all candidates for state elective office.    The Commission also administers the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97, which applies to lobbying activities at the state level.  The Lobbyists Law requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and requires lobbyists and organizations that lobby to report lobbying expenditures and contributions on forms filed with the Commission.  The Commission has jurisdiction over nearly 500 lobbyists representing more than 400 organizations that lobby the state legislature or executive branch.

Ethics Advice  
The Commission issues advisory opinions and other types of guidance (including written staff 
opinion letters by the Commission’s attorneys) about the application of the State Ethics Code and the 
State Lobbyists Law.  In 2021, the Commission’s attorneys received and responded to 851 requests 
for advice from state legislators, state employees, lobbyists, members of the public, and candidates for 
state elective office.  The Commission considers its ability to provide timely and meaningful guidance 
and advice to be one of its most essential functions.   
In 2021 , the Commission issued three formal Advisory Opinions, all of which are available via 
the Commission’s  public data website  and on Westlaw, a legal research platfor m: 
1.Advisory Opinion 2021-1 , advising that agency employees may accept a $100 stipend as  
compensation for work performed for nonprofit organizations outside of work hours.  The  
Commission gave significant weight to the fact that the Agency was partnering with the  
nonprofit organizations to further the State’s interests and that the Agency was encouraging  
the employees to undertake this extra work.  The Commission also stated that a $100  
stipend was not excessive, given that the employees would have to perform between 4.5  and 
7 hours of work – again, outside of state work hours – to receive the stipend.
2.Advisory Opinion 2021-2, advising that agency employees who became employees of a  
nonprofit corporation (rather than remaining as state employees) could communicate with  
their former agency immediately after leaving state service, notwithstanding the post-
employment law (HRS § 84-18), when the nonprofit corporation was created by the state  
agency for the purpose of employing this small class of state employees.
3.Advisory Opinion 2021-3, advising that certain specialized employees are permitted to use  
state equipment on their personal time, given the need for these employees to maintain their  
proficiency in using the specialized equipment.  However, the Commission required the  
employees’ agency to develop and implement a policy to regulate the employees’ personal  
use of state equipment.

2,226 Requests for Advice  Advisory Opinions Interactive Trainings Individuals Trained  Ethics Education  The Commission is charged with educating state officials and employees about ethics in government, HRS § 84-31(a)(7).  To fulfill this mandate, the Commission conducts ethics trainings throughout the year.  Traditionally, the Commission holds in-person trainings throughout the islands, providing participants an interactive education in a face-to-face setting.  In March 2020, the Commission had to suspend all its in-person trainings because of COVID-19.  The Commission pivoted to using videoconference technology to train state officials in real-time – allowing for interactive question-and-answer sessions while adhering to COVID-19 safety regulations.  In 2021, the Commission conducted twenty-three training sessions via videoconference and one session in person. Two of the videoconference sessions offered Continuing Legal Education (“CLE”) credits for government attorneys.  The Commission also conducted mandatory ethics training sessions for newly elected and appointed officials as required by HRS § 84-42.    In addition, after launching an on-demand, on-line training module for state employees in 2020, the Commission developed and launched a second module specifically for members of boards and commissions.  This 35-minute on-line training module can be accessed from any device with an internet connection and is available on the Commission’s website at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/ethicsonlinetraining/.  The Commission expects to launch a third on-line training specifically for public charter school governing board members in January 2022.  A total of 460 individuals completed an on-line training module in 2021, such that the Commission reached a total of 2,226 individuals through its in-person training, web-based training, and videoconference training programs in 2021.     Legislation  In 2021, the Commission successfully advocated for the passage of Act 189 (H.B. 671), which strengthened Hawaii’s post-employment laws:  the measure prohibits certain high-level state employees, including department directors and other heads of agencies, from lobbying for one year after leaving state service.  The measure also provides that former employees are prohibited from using or revealing confidential information gained during state service, regardless of the length of the employees’ state service (as this portion of the post-employment law, HRS § 84-18, previously applied only to employees who served for longer than six months)      
ethics@hawaiiethics.org • (808) 587-0460 • www.ethics.hawaii.gov 5 Enforcement  The Commission enforces the State Ethics Code, HRS chapter 84, and the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97. The Commission receives and reviews complaints and conducts investigations on a confidential basis concerning alleged violations of the law.  When appropriate, the Commission initiates formal charges against individuals who appear to have violated the law. If there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the law has occurred, the Commission may hold a contested case hearing in accordance with HRS chapter 91, Hawaii’s Administrative Procedure Act.    In 2021, the Commission received 123 new complaints of violations of the Ethics Code and Lobbyists Law.  The Commission issued fifteen Resolutions authorizing staff to conduct investigations, issued two Charges (and received – and thereafter dismissed – two Charges against multiple state employees filed by members of the public), and closed 123 cases. The Commission publicly resolved ten Charges and investigations (including those below) by issuing a Resolution of Investigation/Charge document.  The Commission resolved another 32 matters by issuing ethics guidance and closed 119 other matters for lack of jurisdiction, lack of supporting evidence, or another reason.  Many of those cases were referred to other government agencies for action). The Commission assessed a total of $20,300 in administrative penalties, payable to the General Fund, in addition to $328.83 in restitution in one matter.  Notable enforcement actions include:  University of Hawai‘i, Study Abroad Center:  Resolution of Charge 2021-02  The Commission resolved a Charge issued against Sarita Rai, the Director of the Study Abroad Center (“SAC”) at the University of Hawai‘i.  For several years, the SAC sold identification cards to students for use when traveling abroad; students paid several dollars more than the actual cost of the card, and the SAC kept the excess funds in a non-University account.  The respondent then used those funds to pay for alcohol, food, and holiday parties for herself and others.  The respondent admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law (HRS § 84-13) and agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $5,500.    Ka Waihona o Ka Na‘auao Public Charter School:  Resolution of Investigation 2021-06     The Commission resolved an investigation of Alvin Parker, the former Principal of a public charter school.  While Principal of the school, Parker authorized three employees to take cash advances from the school, using school funds.  Cash advances to two employees, totaling $25,000 and $5,000, were repaid in full.  The third employee was Parker’s spouse.  Parker’s 
     
ethics@hawaiiethics.org • (808) 587-0460 • www.ethics.hawaii.gov 6 spouse repaid $5,000 of $13,000 in cash advances, and Parker contended that the remaining $8,000 was properly offset against back pay owed to him.  The respondent admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law (HRS 84-13) in authorizing the cash advances and agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $4,000.  Department of Human Services, Hawai‘i Youth Correctional Facility:  Resolution of Investigation 2021-01 and 2021-02   The Commission resolved investigations of two employees of the Hawai‘i Youth Correctional Facility (“HYCF”).  First, the Institutional Facility Superintendent admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law (HRS § 84-13), and agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $4,000, for using HYCF equipment and other state resources for his private cattle ranching business, among other things.  Second, the HYCF Administrator admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law and agreed to pay a $1,500 administrative penalty for several actions, including (1) authorizing a private religious organization to store several trailers (free of charge) on HYCF property and (2) authorizing state resources to mow/clear private property.    Costco Wholesale Corporation and its Registered Lobbyists:  Resolution of Investigation 2021-04   Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco”) and six registered lobbyists failed to file four consecutive lobbying expenditure reports.  They admitted that they did not file timely lobbying reports and agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $2,000.  Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement:  Resolution of Investigation 2021-08 and 2021-09   The Commission resolved an investigation of a DLNR-DOCARE employee and the employee’s supervisor, both of whom admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law, HRS § 84-13, by spending approximately three hours of state time, on state property, repairing the employee’s personal vehicle.  The employee and supervisor agreed to pay administrative penalties of $300 and $500, respectively.    Financial & Gifts Disclosures The Commission administers the filing requirements of the financial disclosure law and the gifts disclosure law, which help provide accountability and transparency in government.  In 2021, the Commission received 1,846 financial disclosure statements.  Public disclosure statements (for elected officials, department directors, and other designated state officials) are available on the Commission’s public data website.  The Commission received and published 97 gifts disclosure statements, all of which are available on the Commission’s public data website.         
ethics@hawaiiethics.org • (808) 587-0460 • www.ethics.hawaii.gov 7  Judicial Candidate Reviews The Commission provides information to the Judicial Selection Commission on applicants for judicial office.  In 2021, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission provided information on approximately 107 applicants (including current judges seeking retention).    Lobbyists Law: Registration & Expenditure Reports The Commission administers HRS chapter 97, the Lobbyists Law, which requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and file periodic expenditure reports.  In 2019, the Commission launched its new electronic filing system for lobbying registration and reporting, allowing lobbyists to register and file their periodic expenditure reports electronically.  The Commission is continually upgrading and improving the e-filing system for lobbying, financial disclosures, and gifts disclosures; the Commission launched a series of enhancements in 2021 to make it easier for filers to complete their forms.  In 2021, the Commission received and published 894 lobbyist registration statements from 462 lobbyists, representing 396 organizations, along with 1,209 lobbyist expenditure reports.  Although we started a new lobbying cycle in 2021, the numbers are comparable to 2020 (1,018 registration statements, 486 lobbyists, 435 organizations, and 1,207 lobbyist expenditure reports).    Commissioners and Staff  The Commission is comprised of five members nominated by the State Judicial Council and appointed by the Governor for four-year terms, and the Commission welcomed two new members in 2021.  The current members of the Commission are Melinda Wood (Chairperson), Wesley Fong (Vice Chairperson), Reynard Graulty, Harry McCarthy, and Beverley Tobias.  As of January 2022, the Commission employs a staff of nine: Executive Director Robert D. Harris, Associate Director Susan Yoza, three staff attorneys (Nancy Neuffer, Bonita Chang, and Kee Campbell) Computer Specialist Patrick Lui; Office Manager Caroline Choi; Secretary Lynnette Santiago; and Investigator Jason Kamisugi.  As the COVID-19 crisis continued, the Commission – whose budget had been approved prior to onset of the pandemic – cut its expenses, left a staff position vacant, and delayed salary increases for staff.  Consequently, the Commission was able to return 7.7% of its allocated budget to the General Fund ($96,612 out of a total budget of $1,252,667). =;=<

Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission  
Mission & Duties  
 
Established in 1968, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission – the first state ethics commission in the 
United States – represents a commitment by the people of Hawai‘i to the principles that “public 
officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of ethical conduct[,] and that these standards 
come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.”  Ha wai‘i Constitution, article 
XIV.  The constitution further requires that the State, and each of its subdivisions, establish a code of 
ethics for public officers and employees.  
 
Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, t he Commission is responsible for the administration and 
enforcement of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law, chapters 84 and 97, Hawai‘i 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”), respectively.  The Ethics Code includes laws relating to the acceptance and reporting of gifts, confidential informat ion, fair treatment (the prohibited misuse of official position), 
conflicts of interests, state contracts, and post -employment restrictions , along with a requirement that 
state legislators, candidates for state elective office, and certain state employees file financial disclosure statements .   
 For purposes of the State Ethics Code, the Commission has jurisdiction over more than 50,000 state 
officials and employees.  This includes state legislators and other elected state officials, employees of 
the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (except for judges and justices), and members of all state boards and commissions.  The State Ethics Code’s financial disclosure law also applies to all candidates for state elective office.   
 The Comm ission also administers the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97 , which applies to lobbying 
activities at the state level.  The Lobbyists Law requires lobbyists to register with the Commission and requires lobbyists and organizations that lobby to report lobbying expenditures and contributions on 
forms filed with the Commission.  T he Commission has jurisdiction over nearly 500 lobbyists 
representing more than 400 organizations that lobby the state legislature or executive branch.

Ethics Advice  
 
 The Commission issues advisory opinions and other types of guidance (including written staff 
opinion letters by the Commission’s attorneys) about the appli cation of the State Ethics Code and the 
State Lobbyists Law.  In 2020, the Commission’s attorneys rec eived and responded to 950 requests 
for advice  from state legislators, state employees, lobbyists, members of the public , and candidates for 
state elective office.  The Commission considers its ability to provide timely and meaningful  guidance 
and advice to be one of its most essential functions.   
 In 20 20, the Commission issued two formal Advisory Opinions, both  of which are available 
via the Commission’s  public data website
 and on Westlaw, a legal research platfor m: 
 
1. Advisory Opinion 2020- 1, advising that a member of a state board may vote on the 
approval of online continuing education courses  – and administrative rules pertaining to 
those courses  – notwithstanding the member’s personal connections to the president of a 
professional associat ion, provided that the member does not provide any unwarranted 
benefits to the president or professional association. 
 
2. Advisory Opinion 2020- 2, discussing the prohibition against substantial financial 
transactions between supervisors and subordinates , and advising that a member of the state 
legislature may not use private funds to compensate a legislative intern .  
 
 
Ethics Survey of State Employees  
 
The Commission values receiving input from state officials and recognizes that constant 
dialogue is imperative to fostering high ethical standards in government.  With this in mind, the 
Commission worked in partnership with Professors Sonia Ghumman and Han nah-Hahn Nguyen from 
the University of Hawai‘i to design and disseminate an ethics survey to a sample  of state employees 
across Hawai‘i . 
 The Commission developed the ethics survey in order to gain a better awareness of the areas of 
concern that need to be  further addressed through enforcement or education.  This includes the general 
level of familiarity with the State Ethics Code among state workers, potential ethics infractions that may be of concern, and any large or long- standing ethics problems that ma y exist in a particular state 
agency.  The survey was distributed electronically and took an estimated ten minutes to complete.  Survey respondents were provided assurance of anonymity as all identifying information associated with a survey response was re moved.  
 Approximately 2,300 state officials completed the survey, and t he Commission is currently 
collaborating with the University of Hawai‘i to analyze the results and develop meaningful recommendations.  The University researchers and the Commission are also working together on a  
journal article discussing this research and plan to submit the article for publication in early 2021.

official action affecting  a business in which they have a substantial financial interest, such as 
outside private  employment.  The respondent also admitted to violating the Fair Treatment law, 
which prohibits state employees from using state resources for private business purposes.  The 
respondent agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 and the matter was r eferred to 
DLNR -DOCARE for further action as appropriate. 
 
 
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (“DCCA”), Insurance Division :  Resolution of 
Charge 2020- 05

HRS § 84- 11, and the Gifts Reporting law, HRS § 84- 11.5, related to gifts of  hundreds of 
dollars of  meals from a state vendor.  As part of his duties as Chief Examiner, the respondent  
oversaw the vendor’s contract with DCCA, and wa s responsible for negotiating the rate paid to 
the vendor and monitoring the performance of the vendor’s work.  The Gifts law prohibits state 
employees from soliciting or accepting any gift “under circumstances in which it can reasonably be inferred that the gift is intended to influence the . . .employee . . . or is intended as a reward for any official action[.]”  The respondent, who had retired from the State of Hawai‘i prior to the resolution of this Charge, agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $5,000.

used to clear rocks, mud,  and debris from the employee’s  personal property.  T he employee’s 
supervisor, a Superintendent for the DOT Highways Division, admitted to authorizing the 
employee  to transport the Bobcat to the employee’s personal residence, store the Bobcat

Financial  & Gifts  Disclosures  
The Commission administers the filing requirements of the financial disclosure  law and the 
gifts disclosure law, which help provide accountability and transparency in government.  
 
In 2020, the Commission received  1,859 financial disclosure statements , including 181 
disclosure statements for candidates of state elective office.  P ublic disclosure statements (for elected 
officials, department directors, and other designated state officials)  are available on the Commission’s

The Commission received and 
published 188 gifts disclosure statements , all of 
which are available on the Commission’s public data website
.  
  
 
Lobbyists Law: Registration & 
Expenditure Reports  
The Commission administers HRS 
chapter 97, the Lobbyists Law, which requires 
lobbyists to register with the Commission and file periodic expenditure reports.  In 2019, t he 
Commission launched its new electronic filing system for lobbying registration and r eporting, 
allowing lobbyists to register and file their periodic expenditure reports electronically.  The Commission is continually upgrading and improving the e -filing system for lobbying, 
financial disclosures, and gifts disclosures; the Commission launc hed a series of 
enhancements in December 2020 to make it easier for filers to complete their forms.  
 In 2020, the Commission r eceived and published 1,018 lobbyist registration statements from 
486 lobbyists , representing 435 organizations , along with 1,207 lobbyist expenditure reports.  Each of 
these figures represent s a year -over-year increase when compared to 2019  (950 registration statements, 
438 lobbyists, 415 organizations, and 1,009 lobbyist expenditure reports) .

Administrative Rules  
 
After a three -year process of research,  drafting, and deliberation, t he Commission considered 
and promulgated a comprehensive package of administrative rules pursuant to HRS chapter 91.  The 
Commission held a public hearing on May 7, 2020 to gather testimony from all interested persons and discuss the potential  implications  of the proposed changes.  The rules were signed by Governor Ige in 
November 2020 and took effect on November 28, 2020. 
 The new rules provide updated procedures for the issuance of advisory opinions, investigations, 
and contested case hearings.  The rules  also clarify many of the ethics and lobbyists laws administered 
by the Commission, and address topics such as gifts, fair treatment, conflicts of interests, and post -
employment restrictions .  The updated rules are available on the Commission’s website  at 
https://ethics.hawaii.gov/wp- content/uploads/2019/07/TITLE21.pdf
 
  
Anti -Fraud Initiative  
The Commission  partnered with the Department of the Attorney General to launch a n anti -
fraud hotline aimed at identifying fraud, waste, and abuse of government funds.  The agencies developed a  website and  online complaint form  (antifraud.hawaii.gov),  dedicated phone hotline  (587 -
0000) , and dedicated email address ( antifraud@hawaii.gov ) where individuals  can confidentially 
report suspected violations.  These anti -fraud resources were created  to complement the  state’s efforts 
to use CARES Act funds responsibly and empower the public with  confidential, easy- to-use methods 
to report potential violations. 
 Within the first four months of establishing  these anti -fraud resources (September to December 
2020), the Com mission fielded 41 anti -fraud complaints , including 19 complaints submitted using the 
online complaint form.  These 41 complaints were in addition to the 129 complaints received by the Commission through the Commission’s normal complaint channels.  Many of the anti -fraud 
complaints were referred to the relevant administrative agencies for action, and several of those cases resulted in action (policy changes and/or disciplinary action) by the agencies themselves.  
 
Judicial Candidate Reviews  
The Commission provides information to the Judicial Selection Commission on applicants for 
judicial office.  In 2020, the Ha wai‘i  State Ethics Commission provided information on approximately 
87 applicants (including current judges seeking retention).  
 
 
 
      
ethics@hawaiiethics.org  • (808) 587- 0460 • www.ethics.hawaii.gov  9 
Legislation  
 
In 2020, the Commission successfully advocated for the passage of  Act 39 (House Bill 2125) , 
which r equires financial disclosure filers to report the names of clients they assist or represent for pay 
before state agencies and updates the law to provide for electronic filing of disclosures.  The 
Legislature also passed House Bill  2124  without a single “no” vote; the bill would have strengthened 
Hawaii’s post -employment laws  by prohibiting high- level state officials from lobbying the Legislature 
for one year after leaving state service, but the bill was vetoed by the Governor for its possible effects on recruitment for volunteer boards and commissions.  The Commission intends to support a revised version of this measure in 2021 that would exclude volunteer members of boards and commissi ons but 
retain the strong post -employment restrictions for high- level government employees.   
 
Commissioners and Staff  
 
The Commission is comp rised of  five members nominated by the State Judicial Council and 
appointed by the Governor for four -year terms.  The current members of  the Commission are Ruth 
Tschumy (Chairperson), Melinda Wood (Vice Chairperson) , Reynard Graulty, and Wesley Fong.  
There is currently a vacancy on the Commission.  Former member Susan DeGuzman completed her 
second term on June 30, 2020. 
 As of February 2021, t he Commiss ion employs  a staff  of ten: Executive Director Daniel Gluck, 
Associate Director Susan Yoza, four staff attorneys  (Nancy Neuffer, Virginia Chock, Bonita Chang, 
and Kee Campbell) ; Computer  Specialist  Patrick Lui; Office Manager Caroline Choi; Secretary 
Lynnette Santiago; and Investigator Jason Kamisugi.  The Commission has a vacancy for an administrative position that will remain unfilled because of the COVID -19 budget crisis .  As the 
COVID- 19 crisis unfolded at the end of the 2019 -2020 fiscal year, the Commission cut its expenses 
and returned $50,177.44, or approximately 4.2% of the budget (1,202,065) to the General Fund.  The Commission expects to return funds to the General Fund at the end of the  current fiscal year as well.

Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission  
Mission  & Duties  
 
Established in 1968, the Hawai‘i State Ethics Commission – the first state ethics commission 
in the United States – represents a commitment by the people of Hawai‘i to the principles that 
“public officers and employees must exhibit the highest standards of  ethical conduct[,] and 
that these standards come from the personal integrity of each individual in government.”  
Hawai‘i Constitution, article XIV.  The constitution further requires that the State, and each of 
its subdivisions, establish a code of ethics  for public officers and employees.  
 
Pursuant to this constitutional mandate, t he Commission is responsible for the administration 
and enforcement of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law, chapters 84 and 97, 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”), r espectively.  The Ethics Code includes laws relating to the 
acceptance and reporting of gifts, confidential information, fair treatment (the prohibited 
misuse of official position), conflicts of interests, state contracts, and post -employment 
restrictions , along with a requirement that state legislators, candidates for state elective office , 
and certain state employees file financial disclosure statements .   
 
For purposes of the State Ethics Code, the Commission has jurisdiction over more than 
50,000 state officials and employees.  This includes state legislators and other elected state 
officials, employees of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (except 
for judges and justices), and members of all state boards and commissions.  Th e State Ethics 
Code’s financial disclosure law also applies to all candidates for state elective office.   
 
The Commission also administers the State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97 , which applies to 
lobbying activities at the state level.  The Lobbyists Law  requires lobbyists to register with the 
Commission and requires lobbyists and organizations that lobby to report lobbying 
expenditures and contributions on forms filed with the Commission.  T he Commission has 
jurisdiction over more than 400 lobbyists repr esenting over 300 organizations that lobby the 
state legislature or executive branch.

Ethics Advice  
 
 The Commission issues advisory opinions and other types of guidance about the 
appli cation of the State Ethics Code and the State Lobbyists Law .  In 2019, the Commission’s 
attorneys received and responded to 1,389 requests for  advice  from state legislators, state 
employees, lobbyists, and members of the public, including 215 requests for advice on 
whether state officials could accept a particular gi ft of travel (where travel is paid for by a non -
state entity).  The Commission considers its ability to provide timely and meaningful  guidance 
and advice to be one of its most essential functions.   
 
In 2019, the Commission issued seven formal Advisory Opi nions, all of which are 
available on its website at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/all -opinions/  and on Westlaw, a legal 
research platfor m: 
 
1. Advisory Opinion 2019 -1, advising that a member of a state board may not 
represent the board in collective bargaining negotiations with a public -sector union 
when the state board member’s spo use is a member of the public -sector union.  
 
2. Advisory Opinion 2019 -2, advising that the Ethics Code does not necessarily 
prohibit a state agency from soliciting donations from the private s ector, and 
providing a series of guidelines to ensure that any solicitations are not coercive and 
do not provide anyone with an unwarranted benefit.  
 
3. Advisory Opinion 2019 -3, advising that the Ethics Code does not prohibit a 
legislator, in the legislator’s private capacity, from representing a private client in an 
attempted purchase of state property from a state agency.   
 
4. Advis ory Opinion 2019 -4, advising that an employee could not take action on 
matters involving a company when the employee’s spouse works for that company.   
 
5. Advisory Opinion 2019 -5, advising that a  former employee was not prohibited from 
representing a private client in a lawsuit against the employee’s former agency, so 
long as the legal representation does not involve the use or disclosure of 
confidential information acquired during state employmen t. 
 
6. Advisory Opinion 2019 -6, advising that an agency is not prohibited from awarding a 
contract to a company whose employee is on the agency’s board, where, under the 
specific facts present ed to the Commission, the employee was unaware that the 
company was seeking a contract with the agency, and cautioning against potential 
conflicts of interest and abuse of position.  
 
7. Adviso ry Opinion 2019 -7, advising that an employee may accept a complimentary 
registration fee to a vendor’s conference, but advising that the employee may not 
attend a Vendor -sponsored reception for government employees .

Ethics Education  
 
The Commission is charged with educating state officials and employees about ethics 
in government , HRS § 84 -31(a)(7) .  To fulfill this mandate, the Commission conducts ethics 
training se ssions throughout the year.  The Commission has been expanding its educational 
efforts to reach as many state officials as possible.  In 2019, the Commission offered forty-
seven  training sessions for 2,131  individuals, including one session offering Continu ing Legal 
Education (“CLE”) credits for government attorneys.  The Commission also conducted 
mandatory ethics training sessions for all newly elected state officials as required by  
HRS §  84-42.  The Commission b elieves that it is critical  to provide ethic s training for state 
employees to improve their general awareness of ethics and to prevent unknowing violations 
of the Sta te ethics laws.  In fa ct, for many employees, the ethics training is their first e xposure 
to the State Ethics Code.  
 
In 2020, the Commission is launching an on -line training to be available to all state 
employees.  This 30 -minute, interactive session can be accessed from any device with an 
internet connection, and the Commission hopes that this will help to ensure greate r ethics  
awareness by  the more than 50,000 employees and board/commission members who serve 
the people of Hawai‘i.  Anyone can take the training (and receive a certificate of completion 
for doing so) , and view an introductory “Guide to the State Ethics Cod e,” at  
https://ethics.hawaii.gov/ethicsonlinetraining/ .  
 
The Commission also continues to explore new ways to ensure that state officials are 
aware of the Ethics Code’s requirements .  To tha t end, in 2019, the Commission developed 
and distributed three new “Quick Guides” to the Ethics Code on the following topics:  
 
- Holiday Season Ethics Guide  
- Second Jobs and Other Private Business Activities   
- Ethics Reminders for E mployees at State Base Yards and Repair Shops   
 
The Commission has seven of these short educational flyers on its website at 
https://ethics.hawaii.gov/quickguides/ .  
 
 The Commission also published fou r issues of “The High Road ” newsletter , available 
at https://ethics.hawaii.gov/category/guidance/publications/highroad/ .  
 
 
     
ethics@hawaiiethics.org  • (808) 587 -0460  • www.ethics.hawaii.gov  5 
Enforcement  
The Commission enforce s the State 
Ethics Code, HRS chapter 84, and the 
State Lobbyists Law, HRS chapter 97. The 
Commission receives and reviews 
complaints and conducts investigations on 
a confidential basis concerning alleged 
violations of the law.  When appropriate, 
the Commiss ion initiates formal charges 
against individuals who appear to have 
violated the law. If there is probable cause 
to believe that a violation of the law has 
occurred, the Commission may hold a 
contested case hearing in accordance with 
HRS Chapter 91, Hawaii ’s Administrative 
Procedure Act .   
 
In 2019, the Commission received 
65 new complaints of violations of the 
Ethics Code and Lobbyists Law. The Commission issued thirty -two Resolutions authorizing 
staff to conduct investigations, issued two Charges, and closed 7 5 cases. The Commission 
publicly resolved nine Charges and investi gations (including those below)  by issuing a 
Resolution of Investigation/Charge document or Decision & Order ; resolved another twenty -
six matters by issuing ethics guidance; resolved two cases involving late filing of financial 
disclosure statements ; and c losed thirty -eight  other matters (for lack of jurisdiction, lack of 
supporting evidence, or another reason) . The Commission assessed a total of $48,156.53 in 
administrative penalties , payable to the General Fund. Notable enforcement actions include : 
 
Offic e of Hawaiian Affairs (“OHA”) Trustee Rowena Akana:   Decision 2019 -1 and Resolution 
of Charge 2019 -2 
 
The Commission issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and 
Order involving former OHA Trustee Akana ( Decision 2019 -1), concluding that Akana 
committed forty -seven violations of the Ethics Code , including violations of the Gifts 
law (HRS §  84-11), Gifts Reporting law  (HRS §  84-11.5), and Fair Treatment law   
(HRS §  84-13). The Commission imposed an administrative penalty of $23,106.53 and 
referred the matter to the Attorney General to recover prohibited gifts, improperly 
received by Akana, valued at $21,513.15 . Akana appealed . The Circuit Court affirmed 
the Commission’s Decision in full  in September 201 9, and Akana appealed to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals. The Commission also resolved a second Charge 
against Akana arising out of Akana’s disclosure of confidential information from two 
Executive Session me etings of OHA’s Board of Trustees ( Reso lution  of Charge 2019 -
2); Akana agreed to pay an administrative penalty  of $1,500 .

Department of Land and Natural Resources (“DLNR”), Division of Boa ting and Ocean 
Recreation (“DOBOR”), Hawai‘i Island:   Resolution of Investigation 2019 -5    
 
The Commission resolved a case involving a DOBOR Harbor Agent who took official 
action affecting his personal boat (by inspecting his own boat) and who used state time 
and other resources to attend to his personal boat.  The Conflicts of Interests law,  
HRS § 84-14(a), prohibits state employees from taking official action directly affecting 
their own substantial financial interests; the Fair Treatment law, HRS §  84-13, prohibits 
state employees from using their official positions to provide themselves or others with 
unwarranted benefits.  
 
Department of Education (“DOE”), Facilities Maintenance Branch:   Resolution of 
Investigations 2019 -1, 2019 -3, and 2019 -4   
The Commission resolved cases involving three DOE supervisory employees from the 
Facilities Maintenance Branch, all of whom hired subordinate employees for outside 
projects (such as construction work); some of the supervisors also accepted free labor 
from subordinate employees.  The Fair Treatment law,  HRS §  84-13(a)(4), prohibits 
supervisors from engaging in substantial financial transactions f rom subordinates; the 
Gifts law (HRS §  84-11) and the Fair Treatment law (HRS §  84-13) also generally 
prohibits supervisors from receiving free labor for personal projects from subordinate 
employees.  The supervisors agreed to pay administrative penalties of $11,000, 
$3,500, and $750, respectively.   
 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (“DLNR”), Division of Boating and Ocean 
Recreation (“DOBOR”), Kaua‘i:   Resolution of Charge 2019 -1     
 
The Commission resolved a Charge against Bruce Kelekoma, a DOBOR -Kauai official, 
after having resolved cases involving three other  employees  from DOBOR -Kauai in 
2018.  Kelekoma admitted to receiving $2,753.89 in automobile parts and repair 
services , knowing that those parts and services were purchased and paid for using 
state funds; to using a state pCard to purchase automobile parts for his personal 
vehicle; to using state time, personnel, and equipment to transport diesel fuel to his 
family’s pasture land and thereafter pouring the fuel on fence posts as a preservative, 
rather than disposing of it as hazardous waste; to directing subordinate employees to 
cut and deliver kiawe wood to him for his personal use; and to taking official action as a 
DOBOR -Kauai employee affecting his private employer.  Kelekoma also admitted t hat 
he signed Certificates of Disposal (i ndicati ng he disposed of state property ) without 
actually disposing of the property, and that he repeatedly gave incorrect statements to 
Ethics Commission investigators while under oath.  Kelekoma agreed to pay an 
administrative penalty of $4,500, and the matter was re ferred to DLNR .

state  and county ethics officials met 
together  for the first time in Honolulu 
for a one -day conference on 
government ethics.  Conference 
participants included  members and 
staff of the Hawai ‘i State  Ethics 
Commission, the Honolulu  Ethics 
Commission, and the Ethics  Boards

vice to employees, and (3) invest igating and prosecut ing ethics viola-
tions. 
 The State Ethics Code includes the following laws: 
Gifts and Gifts Reporting 
Fair Treatment Confidential Information Conflicts of Interests State Contracts Post-Employment Restrictions 
As a state employee, you are requi red to follow these ethics laws.  
Therefore, it is important to under stand how these laws apply to you. 
        
Guide to the State Ethics Code 
 This Guide summarizes the laws of the State Et hics Code that apply to all state employees in 
Hawai ‘i.  We have also included links to publications  that provide more information about the ethics 
laws (all posted on the State Ethics Commission’s website), and an Ethi cs Quiz that you can take to 
test your knowledge of the State Ethics Code. 
 In addition to using this Guide, we encour age all state employees to take the Hawai ‘i State 
Ethics Commission’s online training program, Ethics for State Employees .  The online training 
program only takes about 30 minutes to complete and covers all of the laws that are discussed in 
this Guide.

The State Ethics Code is 
found in Hawai ‘i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) Chap-
ter 84. 
The State Ethics Code 
also includes a Finan-
cial Disclosure Law.  
For more information, 
see Financial Disclosure 
E-Filing Guide.  FYI FYI  2  
 
II. Gifts and Gifts Reporting 
 
A. Prohibited Gifts (HRS § 84-11) .  Do not accept a gift if it 
is reasonable to infer the gift is giv en to influence or reward your actions 
as a state employee.  
  
Can I Accept This Gift?   The State Ethics Commission looks at 
these factors to determine whether the Gifts Law allows you to accept a 
gift: (1) the relationship between you (or your agency) and the donor of 
the gift; (2) the value of the gift; and (3) whether the gift provides any 
benefit to the State. 
 Prohibited Gifts from Vendors,  Contractors and Others.   A gift 
is more likely to be prohibited if you take official action affecting the do-nor.  You generally may not accept any gifts from someone you inspect, 
investigate, license, or regulate, or  from vendors or contractors who do 
business with your agency.  For exam ple, a state health inspector must 
not accept free food or di scounts from a restaurant  that he or she in-
spects.  
 Gifts of Travel.   Contact the State Ethics Commission for guid-
ance if an organization offers to pay fo r your travel expenses for a trip 
(even if the trip is for state work purposes).  The Commission will advise 
you whether you may accept a gi ft of travel based upon information 
about your situation. 
    
B. Gifts Reporting (HRS § 84-11.5).   File a gifts disclosure 
statement to report a gift that y ou (or your spouse or dependent child) 
receive if all of  these conditions are met: 
 (1) The value of the gift, or t he combined value of two or more 
gifts from the same source, is more than $200;  
(2)  The source of the gift(s) has interests that may be affected 
by your actions as a state employee; and 
(3)  The gift is not exempt from reporting by law. 
Gifts Disclosure Statements are due on June 30 for gifts received be-
tween June 1 of the previous year and May 31 of the year of the report.

Law and instructions on

sure form, see Gift Dis-
closure E-Filing Guide . To request guidance

ment, hospitality, or in 
any other form.

III.  Fair Treatment (HRS § 84-13(a))  
 Do not use your state position to  give “unwarranted” privileges or 
advantages to yourself or others.  In other words,  do not use your state 
position to unfairly benefit yourself or anyone else. 
  The following prohibitions also apply to you: 
A. Outside Employment.   Do not use your state position to 
obtain outside employment or contracts for yourself.  
B. Additional Compensation for State Duties.   Do not ac-
cept additional pay for doing your state job other than what the law 
allows you to receive. 
C. Use of State Resources for Private Business.   Do not 
use state time, equipment, facilities,  or other state resources (such 
as state e-mail and state personnel) for private business  activi-
ties, including private sales trans actions, fundraising for private 
clubs or charities, and political ca mpaign activities.   For example, 
do not sell crafts in your state office conference room, do not use 
your state e-mail to organize a sign- waving activity for a political 
candidate, and do not sell cookies to support your child’s soccer team in your state office. 
D. Financial Transactions Between Supervisors and Sub-
ordinates.   Do not enter into substant ial financial transactions with 
subordinates or anyone you supervise  or inspect.  For example, 
do not hire a subordinate employee to perform outside work for 
you, and do not rent an apartment to or from a subordinate em-
ployee. 
 
IV. Confidential Information (HRS § 84-12)  
 Do not disclose confidential informat ion that you acquire from your 
state job or use confidential inform ation to benefit yourself or anyone 
else.

 V. Conflicts of Interests (HRS § 84-14)  
  
 A. Disqualify Yourself When You Have a Conflict  
(HRS § 84-14(a)).   Do not take any official action affecting a business  
in which you have a financial interest. 
You have a “ financial interest ” in a business  if you (or your spouse, 
civil union partner, or  dependent child) have any of these interests: 
If you have any of these financial inte rests in a business, you must dis-
qualify yourself from taking official action affecting that business.  For 
example, if your spouse is employ ed by a company or is on the board 
of directors of a non-profit organiza tion, you must disqualify yourself 
from taking any official action as a state employee affecting that compa-
ny or non-profit organization.    B. No New Conflicts of Inte rests (HRS § 84-14(b)).   Do not 
acquire a new financial interest in any  business that may be affected by

ond job with a private company  if you take official action as a state em-
ployee affecting that company.   C. No Assisting or Representing Others Before Your 
State Agency  (HRS § 84-14(d)).   Do not assist or represent others for 
pay (1) in transactions before your state agency, or (2) on matters you

anything you do as a state

your personal judgment or 
discretion.  Official action 
includes giving your ad-vice, approval, disapprov-
al, opinions, or recom-
mendations about some-
thing even if you are not 
the final decision maker.

 Introduction  
 The State Ethics Code is a set of laws that require ethical con-
duct by state legislators, state employees , and the members of state 
boards and commissions.  These laws promote integrity and public con-
fidence in government.  
 The State Ethics Commission administers the State Ethics Code 
by: (1) educating state officials about the ethics laws; (2) giving ethics 
advice to state officials; and (3) investigating and prosecuting ethics vio-
lations.  The Ethics Commission also administers a financial disclo-
sure law, which requires certain state officials — including the members 
of many boards and commissions — to file an annual disclosure of fi-
nancial interests.  These disclosures help ensure governmental account-
ability.  
 The State Ethics Code includes the following laws:  
Gifts and Gifts Reporting  
Fair Treatment  
Confidential Information  
Conflicts of Interests  
State Contracts  
Post-Employment Restrictions  
If you are a state board or commission member, it is important to 
understand how these ethics laws apply to you.  
 
Ethics Guide  
 This Guide  summarizes the laws in the State Ethics Code that apply to all state board and 
commission members in Hawai ‘i.  These laws require state officials to uphold high standards of ethi-
cal conduct.  
 We encourage all state board and commission members to learn more about their responsi-
bilities under the State Ethics Code by taking the Hawai ‘i State Ethics Commission ’s online training 
program,  Ethics for State Board and Commission Members . The online training program only 
takes about 30 minutes to complete and covers all the laws discussed in this Guide.  
 Note :  This Guide is intended for instructional purposes only and is not meant to be a com-
plete statement of the law.  HAWAI ‘I STATE ETHICS COMMISSION

The State Ethics Code  is 
found in Hawai ‘i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS ”) chapter 
84; the Ethics Commis-
sion’s administrative rules 
interpret the Ethics Code 
(Title 21, chapters 1 -10). 
Financial disclosures  
must be filed by state 
board and commission 
members whose original 
terms of office are more 
than one year and whose 
duties are not solely advi-
sory.  For more infor-
mation, see Financial

for State Board and Commission Members  3    
 
I. Gifts and Gifts Reporting  
 
A. Prohibited Gifts (HRS § 84 -11).  Do not accept a gift if it 
is reasonable to infer the gift is given to influence or reward your actions 
as a board or commission member.  
  
Can I Accept This Gift?   The State Ethics Commission looks at 
these factors to determine whether the Gifts Law allows you to accept a 
gift: (1) the relationship between your board and the donor of the gift; 
(2) the value of the gift; and (3) whether the gift provides any benefit to 
the State.  
 
Prohibited Gifts from Regulated Entities, Vendors, Contrac-
tors, and Others.   A gift is more likely to be prohibited if you take official 
action affecting the donor.  You and your agency ’s staff generally may 
not accept any gifts from someone who is regulated by your board, a 
party to a contested case before your board, or vendors or contractors 
who do business with your board.  For example, a member of a state 
board may not accept a free dinner from a consultant who has a contract 
with the board.  
 
Gifts of Travel.   Contact the State Ethics Commission for guid-
ance if an organization offers to pay for your travel expenses for a trip 
(even if the trip is for a state purpose).  The Commission will advise you 
whether you may accept a gift of travel based upon information about 
your situation.  
    
B. Gifts Reporting (HRS § 84 -11.5).   File a gifts disclosure 
statement to report a gift that you (or your spouse/civil union partner or 
dependent child) receive if all of these conditions are met:  
 (1) The value of the gift, or the combined value of two or more 
gifts from the same source, is more than $200;  
(2)  The source of the gift(s) has interests that may be affected 
by your actions as a state board member; and 
(3)  The gift is not exempt from reporting by law.  
Gifts disclosure statements are due on June 30 for gifts received be-
tween June 1 of the previous year and May 31 of the year of the report.   
 
 
 
 
For more information 
about the Gifts Reporting 
Law and instructions on 
how to file a gifts disclo-
sure form, see Gift Dis-
closure E -Filing Guide . To request guidance 
about a Gift of Travel, use

Form for Travel Expenses 
Paid By Non -State Enti-
ties  The Gifts Law applies to 
any gift , whether in the 
form of money, service, 
loan, travel, entertain-
ment, hospitality, or in 
any other form.

II. Fair Treatment (HRS § 84 -13(a))  
 Do not use your state position to give “unwarranted ” privileges or 
advantages to yourself or others.  In other words, do not use your state 
position to unfairly benefit yourself or anyone else.  
  The following prohibitions also apply to you:  
A. Outside Employment.   Do not use your state position to 
obtain outside employment or contracts for yourself.  
B. Additional Compensation for State Duties.   Do not ac-
cept any compensation for performing your state duties unless 
permitted by law.  For example, do not accept any payment from a 
private organization for performing services that are part of your 
duties as a state board member.  
C. Use of State Resources for Private Business.   Do not 
use state time, equipment, facilities, or other state resources (such 
as state e -mail and state personnel) for private business  activi-
ties, including private sales transactions, fundraising for private 
clubs or charities, and political campaign activities .  For exam-
ple, do not promote your private business at a state board meeting 
and do not sell tickets for a charity fundraiser in a state office.  
D. Financial Transactions Between Supervisors and Sub-
ordinates.   Do not enter into substantial financial transactions with 
subordinates or anyone you supervise or inspect as a state board 
member.  For example, do not hire a subordinate state employee 
to perform outside work for you, and do not rent an apartment to 
or from a subordinate employee.  
 
III. Confidential Information (HRS § 84 -12)  
 Do not disclose confidential information that you acquire from your 
state duties or use confidential information to benefit yourself or anyone 
else.

 IV. Conflicts of Interests (HRS § 84 -14) 
  
 A. Disqualify Yourself When You Have a Conflict  
(HRS § 84 -14(a)).   Do not take any official action affecting a business  
in which you have a financial interest . 
You have a “financial interest ” in a business  if you (or your spouse, 
civil union partner, or dependent child) have any of these interests:  
If you have any of these financial interests in a business, you must dis-
qualify yourself from taking official action affecting that business.  For 
example, if your spouse is employed by a company or is on the board 
of directors of a non -profit organization, you must disqualify yourself 
from taking any official action as a state board member affecting that 
company or non -profit organization.  
  
 B. “Expert ” Board Members.  Board members who are re-
quired by law to represent particular interests, or to have special qualifi-
cations for serving on their boards, may take official action affecting 
certain businesses or professions in general, but may not take action 
that specifically affects only their own businesses.  For example, an 
“expert ” member of a professional licensing board may take official ac-
tion that will broadly affect all licensees, but may not take action that will 
specifically affect only his or her own license or business.

al, or any other discre-
tionary action that you

ed.

 I. Introduction  
 The State Ethics Code is a set of laws that require ethical conduct 
by state legislators, state employ ees, and the members of state boards 
and commissions.  These laws promot e integrity and public confidence 
in government. 
 The State Ethics Commission admi nisters the State Ethics Code 
by (1) educating employees about the ethics laws, (2) giving ethics ad-
vice to employees, and (3) invest igating and prosecut ing ethics viola-
tions. 
 The State Ethics Code includes the following laws: 
Gifts and Gifts Reporting 
Fair Treatment Confidential Information Conflicts of Interests State Contracts Post-Employment Restrictions 
As a state employee, you are requi red to follow these ethics laws.  
Therefore, it is important to under stand how these laws apply to you. 
        
Guide to the State Ethics Code 
 This Guide summarizes the laws of the State Et hics Code that apply to all state employees in 
Hawai ‘i.  We have also included links to publications  that provide more information about the ethics 
laws (all posted on the State Ethics Commission’s website), and an Ethi cs Quiz that you can take to 
test your knowledge of the State Ethics Code. 
 In addition to using this Guide, we encour age all state employees to take the Hawai ‘i State 
Ethics Commission’s online training program, Ethics for State Employees .  The online training 
program only takes about 30 minutes to complete and covers all of the laws that are discussed in 
this Guide. 
 Note :  This Guide to the State Ethics Code is in tended for instructional purposes only and is 
not meant to be a complete  statement of the law.

The State Ethics Code is 
found in Hawai ‘i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) Chap-
ter 84. 
The State Ethics Code 
also includes a Finan-
cial Disclosure Law.  
For more information, 
see Financial Disclosure 
E-Filing Guide.  FYI FYI  2  
 
II. Gifts and Gifts Reporting 
 
A. Prohibited Gifts (HRS § 84-11) .  Do not accept a gift if it 
is reasonable to infer the gift is giv en to influence or reward your actions 
as a state employee.  
  
Can I Accept This Gift?   The State Ethics Commission looks at 
these factors to determine whether the Gifts Law allows you to accept a 
gift: (1) the relationship between you (or your agency) and the donor of 
the gift; (2) the value of the gift; and (3) whether the gift provides any 
benefit to the State. 
 Prohibited Gifts from Vendors,  Contractors and Others.   A gift 
is more likely to be prohibited if you take official action affecting the do-nor.  You generally may not accept any gifts from someone you inspect, 
investigate, license, or regulate, or  from vendors or contractors who do 
business with your agency.  For exam ple, a state health inspector must 
not accept free food or di scounts from a restaurant  that he or she in-
spects.  
 Gifts of Travel.   Contact the State Ethics Commission for guid-
ance if an organization offers to pay fo r your travel expenses for a trip 
(even if the trip is for state work purposes).  The Commission will advise 
you whether you may accept a gi ft of travel based upon information 
about your situation. 
    
B. Gifts Reporting (HRS § 84-11.5).   File a gifts disclosure 
statement to report a gift that y ou (or your spouse or dependent child) 
receive if all of  these conditions are met: 
 (1) The value of the gift, or t he combined value of two or more 
gifts from the same source, is more than $200;  
(2)  The source of the gift(s) has interests that may be affected 
by your actions as a state employee; and 
(3)  The gift is not exempt from reporting by law. 
Gifts Disclosure Statements are due on June 30 for gifts received be-
tween June 1 of the previous year and May 31 of the year of the report.  
 
 
 
 
For more information 
about the Gifts Reporting 
Law and instructions on 
how to file a gifts disclo-
sure form, see Gift Dis-
closure E-Filing Guide . To request guidance 
about a Gift of Travel, use 
Travel Questionnaire 
Form for Travel Expenses 
Paid By Non-State Enti-
ties  The Gifts Law applies to 
any gift , whether in the 
form of money, service, 
loan, travel, entertain-
ment, hospitality, or in 
any other form.

III.  Fair Treatment (HRS § 84-13(a))  
 Do not use your state position to  give “unwarranted” privileges or 
advantages to yourself or others.  In other words,  do not use your state 
position to unfairly benefit yourself or anyone else. 
  The following prohibitions also apply to you: 
A. Outside Employment.   Do not use your state position to 
obtain outside employment or contracts for yourself.  
B. Additional Compensation for State Duties.   Do not ac-
cept additional pay for doing your state job other than what the law 
allows you to receive. 
C. Use of State Resources for Private Business.   Do not 
use state time, equipment, facilities,  or other state resources (such 
as state e-mail and state personnel) for private business  activi-
ties, including private sales trans actions, fundraising for private 
clubs or charities, and political ca mpaign activities.   For example, 
do not sell crafts in your state office conference room, do not use 
your state e-mail to organize a sign- waving activity for a political 
candidate, and do not sell cookies to support your child’s soccer team in your state office. 
D. Financial Transactions Between Supervisors and Sub-
ordinates.   Do not enter into substant ial financial transactions with 
subordinates or anyone you supervise  or inspect.  For example, 
do not hire a subordinate employee to perform outside work for 
you, and do not rent an apartment to or from a subordinate em-
ployee. 
 
IV. Confidential Information (HRS § 84-12)  
 Do not disclose confidential informat ion that you acquire from your 
state job or use confidential inform ation to benefit yourself or anyone 
else.

Second Jobs and Other 
Private Business Activi-
ties and Quick Guide on

ployees .   A “business ” includes a 
for-profit company, non-
profit organization, and a 
political campaign. Guide to the State Ethics Code  4  
 
   
 
 
 
 V. Conflicts of Interests (HRS § 84-14)  
  
 A. Disqualify Yourself When You Have a Conflict  
(HRS § 84-14(a)).   Do not take any official action affecting a business  
in which you have a financial interest. 
You have a “ financial interest ” in a business  if you (or your spouse, 
civil union partner, or  dependent child) have any of these interests: 
If you have any of these financial inte rests in a business, you must dis-
qualify yourself from taking official action affecting that business.  For 
example, if your spouse is employ ed by a company or is on the board 
of directors of a non-profit organiza tion, you must disqualify yourself 
from taking any official action as a state employee affecting that compa-
ny or non-profit organization.    B. No New Conflicts of Inte rests (HRS § 84-14(b)).   Do not 
acquire a new financial interest in any  business that may be affected by 
your official action as a state empl oyee.  For example, do not get a sec-
ond job with a private company  if you take official action as a state em-
ployee affecting that company.   C. No Assisting or Representing Others Before Your 
State Agency  (HRS § 84-14(d)).   Do not assist or represent others for 
pay (1) in transactions before your state agency, or (2) on matters you 
have worked on, or will work on, as part of your state job. “Official action ” means 
anything you do as a state 
employee that involves 
your personal judgment or 
discretion.  Official action 
includes giving your ad-vice, approval, disapprov-
al, opinions, or recom-
mendations about some-
thing even if you are not 
the final decision maker.

Re: Request for a Good Cause Exemption to Nepotism Prohibition 
 (REQ-2024-0116)  
 
Dear Dr. Tina Tauasosi-Posiulai, 
 
Thank you for contacting our o Ưice regarding your request for a good cause 
exemption to the Nepotism Law. As a Community  Partnership and Research Specialist with 
the University of Hawai ʻi at Manoa, you requested an exemption to allow your son, Jordan 
Posiulai, to be hired as a student mentor. Th e student mentor program you oversee aims to 
enhance the recruitment, enrollment, mentoring, and graduation success of Paci ﬁc Island 
students in Hawai ʻi secondary schools. The position in question necessitates the 
proﬁciency in a Paci ﬁc Island language. 
 
Six applicants responded to the position, and only three (including Mr. Posiulai) 
were deemed quali ﬁed. While you hired the other two applicants, you additionally seek to 
hire Mr. Posiulai.  
The position was initially advertised for approximately seven to ten days. Following 
our feedback, the position was re-advertised from October 3rd to October 16th through the University of Hawai ʻi’s student hiring website and social media platforms. No new 
applicants responded to the re-advertised position.   
The compensation package for this position is commensurate with other student 
positions and is primarily funded by a limited state budget allocation and federal 
work -study funds. 
 Dr. Tina Tauasosi-Posiulai 
November 6, 2024 Page 2  
 
Regarding the supervision of your son, you indicated you will train all student 
mentors during the initial week or two. Subseq uently, the student mentors will be assigned 
high schools or communities to tutor and mentor. Student mentors are independently 
responsible for conducting weekly team meetings with their assigned students. Your supervision will primarily involve reviewing a weekly work journal submitted by the student 
mentors, which details the work completed, th e date, and the time. Your direct supervisor 
is aware of this arrangement and can addres s any concerns regarding your hiring or 
ongoing supervision of your son should any unforeseen circumstances or con ﬂicts arise. 
 
Based on the information provided, we are satis ﬁed that you meet the criteria 
necessary to qualify for a good cause exempt ion. The position itself has a reasonable 
requirement, namely knowledge of a Paci ﬁc Island language, which narrows the pool of 
quali ﬁed applicants. Reasonable e Ưorts were made to advertise the position 
(approximately twenty days), with additional targeted e Ưorts made to Paci ﬁc Island 
communities through social media. Only three quali ﬁed applicants expressed interest in 
the position, and you intend to hire all three applicants.  
Consequently, you may hire and supervise Mr. Posiulai for the duration of this 
student mentor position (presumably until the end of the academic year). Should any material facts change, or if the information pr ovided is inaccurate or incomplete, you may 
need to reapply for another good cause exception. 
 
Furthermore, if you have any objections to any portion of this letter, you may, 
pursuant to the Order Regarding Applications for Good Cause Exceptions to the Nepotism 
Law issued on May 17, 2023, appeal to the full Ethics Commission for reconsideration.  
Should you have any questions or wish to di scuss this matter further, please contact 
me at 808.587.0460. 
  Sincerely,   /s Robert D. Harris    Robert D. Harris

Ms. Michele A. Nagamine 
Head Coach, Women’s Soccer 
University of Hawaii Athletics - Soccer 
1337 Lower Campus Road 
Honolulu, Hawaii 96825 
  
 Re: Request for a Good Cause Exception to Nepotism Prohibition (OTH-24-00360)  
 
Dear Ms. Nagamine, 
 
Thank you for contacting the Hawaiʻi State Ethics Commission (the “Commission”) to 
request a good cause exception to the Nepotism Law. As Head Coach of the women's soccer 
program (the “Program”) in the Athletic Department at the University of Hawai‘i (“UH”), you 
have oversight over Program staff, and you requested the exception so that the Program could 
hire your niece, Natalie Nagamine, for a Team Manager position.  
 
After reviewing the information provided by you and your department, it is our opinion 
that good cause does not exist for a waiver of the Nepotism Law. We recommend you reopen 
recruitment efforts and solicit additional applicants for the position. 
 
Background: 
 
The Nepotism Law is intended to help avoid conflicts of interest by ensuring an equal 
playing field for state employees and applicants for state positions. It prohibits state employees 
from taking employment action affecting relatives or household members.1 Employment action 
includes hiring, evaluating, supervising, promoting/demoting, and terminating. While the law 
allows the Commission to grant an exception upon good cause shown, exceptions are rarely 
granted absent compelling and extraordinary circumstances. 
 
 
 
 
 
1 The Nepotism Law is at Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes § 84-13.2 . For more information, please refer to the Nepotism 
Quick Guide,  posted on the Commission’s website.   
Ms. Michele A. Nagamine 
August 9, 2024 
Page 2 
 
 
Analysis: 
 
The details provided by you and your department suggest that you were involved in the 
hiring process for the Team Manager role. Given your active participation in this process, recusal 
from the application of the nepotism law would not be appropriate. 
Moreover, the position in question was advertised for just one week. Considering this 
brief recruitment period, allowing an exception would compromise the Nepotism Law's objective 
to prevent conflicts of interest and uphold public trust in the fairness and integrity of state 
employment practices. 
 
Guidance: 
 
For future reference, the Commission typically looks for a wide-ranging recruitment 
effort before considering an exception. Posting the position for longer than a week, advertising 
on multiple platforms, in different manners, and targeting relevant departments at UH would 
demonstrate a sincere effort to find qualified candidates. For example, some agencies broaden 
their applicant pool by posting positions on commercial job search websites or their own 
department website, in addition to the UH jobs website. Beyond online postings, manners of 
advertising include flyer postings on campus bulletin boards, using email list-servs, posting on 
social media, and announcing at department meetings (you mentioned that you had asked 
Program athletes to refer classmates that might be interested). For this particular position, it may 
also be useful to target relevant UH departments such as Kinesiology, Secondary Education, 
Women’s Studies, and similar graduate programs to solicit applicants likely to have an interest in 
working with the Program. If, after such efforts, there remains a lack of qualified candidates and 
a compelling need to fill the position, the Commission may consider a good cause exception.  
 
Thank you for consulting with the Commission. If you need further assistance in 
complying with the Nepotism Law, please do not hesitate to contact our office. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 s/ Jennifer M. Yamanuha

 Re: Request for a Good Cause Exemption to Nepotism Prohibition  
(OTH 24-00327)     
 
Dear Principal Krug, Jr., 
 
Thank you for contacting our office to request a good cause exemption to the 
Nepotism Law. You are the principal of Ka Waihona o ka Naʻauao Public Charter 
School (the “school”). You requested a good cause exemption so that your son, 
Kaulakauikeaokea Hoakua Krug may be hired as a teacher at the school. In your 
application form and a subsequent call on May 23, 2024, you informed the Hawaiʻi State 
Ethics Commission (“Commission”) staff that the school had nine new positions for 
Hawaiian language immersion licensed teachers, and the hiring committee decided to 
hire all who applied, including your son, and there are still two more vacancies. Also, the 
school is located in Nanakuli, which has less population than Honolulu. You were not 
involved in the hiring process, and will not be involved in the supervision, evaluation, 
promotion/demotion, or termination of your son.  
 
With regard to the supervision of Kaulakauikeaokea Hoakua Krug, you indicated 
that the Vice Principal will be his immediate supervisor, and a second Vice Principal 
would fill in, if, for some reason the first Vice Principal is on extended leave, etc. Also, 
you have indicated that the Vice Principals are not under your direct supervision, but 
rather they are evaluated and maintain an employment contract directly with the 
school’s Governing Board. If any issues were to arise involving hiring, evaluating, 
promotion, demotion, or termination of your son, then the Vice Principals could consult 
the school’s Governing Board in addressing any unforeseen circumstances or conflicts 
related to your son’s supervision.  
 
Based on the information provided, it is our opinion that the Nepotism Law does 
not prohibit the school from hiring your son because you have shown that you intend to 
comply with the law without the necessity of a good cause exemption. The Nepotism 
Law prohibits state employees from taking employment actions affecting relatives or 
household members. Employment actions include hiring, evaluating, demoting,

promoting, terminating, or supervising a relative or household member. The law further 
provides that the Commission may grant an exemption from this law upon good cause 
shown. Good cause may include a demonstrated lack of qualified employees or 
candidates.1 
 
In this case, a good cause exemption is not required because you have indicated 
that you will not supervise or take action affecting your son, nor did you participate in his 
hiring process. If circumstances change, such as you find yourself in a position of 
supervising or taking official action directly affecting Kaulakauikeaokea Hoakua Krug, or 
if he were to apply to a different position within the school, it may necessitate 
submission of another good cause exception request. 
 
Finally, you should be aware of an additional section of the Ethics Code. Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes §84-13(a) prohibits state employees from using their state positions to 
grant themselves or anyone else any unwarranted benefit or advantage. State 
employees who work alongside relatives must be cautious not to accord their relatives 
any special treatment. 
 
Thank you for your request for an exemption. This letter is based on the 
information you provided. If the information is inaccurate or incomplete, please inform 
us as soon as possible, as this may affect our decision. Further, if you disagree with any 
portion of this letter, you may, pursuant to the Order Regarding Applications for Good 
Cause Exceptions to the Nepotism Law issued on May 17, 2023, appeal to the full 
Ethics Commission for reconsideration.2 
 
If you have any questions or want to discuss this matter further, please contact 
me at (808) 587-0460. 
 
Sincerely,
