 Hawaii’s Census Geograph y 
A guide to the  U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 Census boundaries  
This guide was created by the Hawaii State Data Center, Research & Economic Analysis Division, 
DBEDT. See also U.S. Census Bureau, Geographic Programs and Products Glossary . View reference 
maps, subject maps, and additional geographic reference material on our Geography  page.  Jump start

Islands  
The 7 populated islands are Hawaii  (Big Island) , Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. Census 
tracts must be utilized to obtain data for island areas of Maui County and Kauai County  because islands 
are not a Census Bureau geography. Within Maui County, Lanai Island consists of census tract 316.01; 
Molokai Island consists of census tracts 317, 318.01, and 319 (the census tract that is a part of Kalawao County , not to be confused with tract 319 Spreckelsville on Maui Island ); and Maui Island  consists of the 
remaining census tracts in the county.  Within Kauai County, Niihau and Kaula Island is census tract 412 
and Kauai Island consists of the remaining census tracts in the county.  Outsid e of the d ecennial 
census, data are not available for tract 412.   (Count:   7 populated islands)  
Counties  
Hawaii has 5 counties . The 5 counties in the State of Hawaii are Honolulu, Hawaii, Kalawao, Kauai, and 
Maui. Kalawao County is the part of Molokai Island known as the Kalaupapa Settlement. It is administered by the Hawaii State Department of Health.   (Count:  5 counties) 
Census designated places (CDPs) 
Census designated places (CDPs or Places)  are statistical geograph ies representing closely settled, 
unincorporated communities that are locally recognized and identifiable by name.  CDPs are statistical 
equivalents of incorporated  places and represent unincorporated communities that do not have a legally 
defined boundary or an active functioning governmental structure . They are concentrations  of population 
that only cover selected land areas in Hawaii. There are 163 Places in the state as of 2020; 54 are in Hawaii 
County, 55 are in Honolulu County, 30 are in Maui County, and 24 are in Kauai County. (Count : 163 CDPs)  
Census tracts 
Census tracts are small statistical subdivisions o f a county or statistically equi valent entity that  will 
generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people . The b oundaries  of census tracts  are 
drawn with the intention of being maintained over a long period so that comparisons can be made from census to census. The size  of census tracts depends on population size . A tract can be split due to 
population growth or merged because of population decline.   
County planning offices in Hawaii provide the Department of Business, Economic Development & 
Tourism with area names for each census tract
. For example, Honolulu County’s census tract 52 is 
named “Chinatown .” We are one of the only states in the U.S. that have names assigned to each census 
tract. However, these are not official U.S. Census Bureau names.  
Tract n umbers are only unique by county and can be repeated in the same state.  The only  tract number  
that is repeated is 319 , which is used for  Spreckelsville in Maui County and Kalawao in Kalawao County 
on the island of Molokai.  Tracts are  often used for “small area” analyses. (Count: 4 36 census tracts, 
excluding shoreline water tracts)   
 
Page | 2    April 2024  
 Incorporated places (Cities)  
Incorporated places are legally incorporated under state law, have a legally defined boundary, and an 
active functioning governmental structure. Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the Census Bureau.  In agreement with the state, the legal consolidation of city -county  is 
not recognized for census purposes except for the Census of Governments . 
Congressional districts  
The congressional districts used for the 2020 Census were the ones in effect for the 11 6th U.S. Congress. 
After reapportionment,  which was based on the 2020 Census, the Congressional districts for the 118th 
congress were used by the Census Bureau. Hawaii had 2 Congressional districts for both the 116th 
Congress and the 118th Congress. (Count: 2 Congressional Districts)  
Hawaiian Home Lands  (HHLs) 
HHLs are areas held in trust for Native Hawaiians by the State of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, as amended. The Census Bureau obtains the names and boundaries for HHLs from state officials.  
 There are data for  26 HHLs on  Hawaii  Island, 8 on Kauai, 1 on Lanai, 6 on 
Molokai, 11 on Maui Island, and 22 on Oahu . (Count: 74 Hawaiian Home Lands  with data ) 
Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)  
Zip Code Tabulation Areas  (ZCTAs) are approximate representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) five-
digit ZIP codes . Not all ZIP codes in use by the USPS may have a ZCTA delineated to represent them , as 
ZIP codes are designed for the efficient delivery of mail and not intended to represent populations.  By 
popular request, ZCTAs first appeared as a census geographic level in 2000.  (Count: 9 7) 
Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)  
Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are geographic areas with populations of 100,000 people or more. They are the statistical geographic areas  used for the dissemination of decennial census and American 
Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)  files. 
PUMAs 306 and 307 on O ahu changed between 2010 and 2020. These c hanges were made to align the 
PUMAs with county planning department definitions of the areas. The n ames and PUMA numbers did not 
change . For more information on these changes , follow this link
. 
Kauai County  does not meet the population threshold for its own PUMA. As a result, Kauai, Maui , and 
Kalawao Counties are combined in PUMA 100. Hawaii has a total of 10 PUMAs. Area names for each 
PUMA are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.  (Count: 10 P ublic Use Microdata Areas ) 
Judicial district s 
Judicial Districts are not a separate census geographic level. Judicial district areas may be obtained by utilizing the  Census Bureau’s county subdivision geography. See the conversion table
 for guidance on 
creating judicial districts . (Count: 28 judicial districts ) 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)  
MSAs contain an urban core population of at least 50,000 people . Urban Honolulu MSA covers the same 
area as the City and County of Honolulu .  Until 2013, Kahului ‐Wailuku ‐Lahaina, which consists of Maui 
County,  was a Micropolitan Statistical Area . In 2013, it became Hawaii’s second M etropolitan Statistical 
Area . (Count: 2  Metropolitan Statistical Areas)   
 
Page | 3    April 2024  
 Micropolitan Statistical Area s 
Micropolitan statistical areas contains an urban core population ranging from a minimum of 10,000 to a 
maximum of 50,000 people.  There are 2 Micropolitan Statistical Areas. The Hilo Micropolitan Statistical 
Area consists of Hawaii County and Kapaau Micropolitan Statistical Area consists of Kauai County . 
(Count: 2 Micropolitan Statistical areas)  
Urban and rural area s 
Urban areas represent densely developed territory, and encompass residential, commercial, and other 
non -residential urban land uses. The Census Bureau delineates urban areas after each decennial 
census. Rural areas are all land areas that are not a part of an urban area. 
In 2010, there were two types of urban areas -- 1) urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, 
and 2) urban clusters with at least 2,500 people, but less than 50,000.  For 2020, the Census Bureau 
changed its criteria for urban areas to the following  ways : 1) All qualifying areas are now “urban areas.” 
The Census Bureau no longer distinguishes between “urbanized areas” and “urban clusters.” 2) The minimum population threshold for an urban area was increased to 5,000. 3 ) Qualifications were 
updated to include housing unit density in addition to population density. The minimum housing unit  
threshold  is 2,000 housing units.  See this DBEDT report
 for more information about the 2020 Urban and 
Rural areas. (Count: 15 Urban areas) 
School districts 
School districts are geographic entities within which public educational services are provided by a 
government entity for the area’s residents.  In the state of Hawaii, there is only one  school district 
because the school system is statewide. (Count: 1 School district)  
County subdivisions  
County subdivisions  are the primary divisions of counties and equivalent entities that include county 
divisions, census subareas, minor civil divisions, and unorganized territories . They  can be classified as 
either legal or statistical  entities . 
Legal entities , or minor civil divisions  (MCD) , are the primary governmental or administrative divisions o f 
a county . They represent many kinds of legal entities with a variety of governmental or administrative 
functions. There are no minor civil divisions in Hawaii. 
Statistical entities , or census county divisions  (CCDs) , are delineated by the Census Bureau in 
partnership with local governments. CCDs have no legal function . Their  boundaries usually coincide with 
census tract boundaries . CCDs are in areas where there are no MCDs. (Count: 44 county subdivisions)  
State Legislative Districts 
State legislative districts are the areas from which members  of the state legislature  are elected. The 
Hawaii legislature is bicameral (having two chambers)  and includes  the House  and the Senate. (Count: 
51 State House districts, 25 State Senate districts)  
Voting Districts 
Voting Districts are geographic areas established by state governments for the purpose of conducting 
elections . Prior to the 2020  Census , there were 3 44 voting districts . At the time of publication , data for 
individual voting districts is not available for Hawaii for 2020 and beyond .
