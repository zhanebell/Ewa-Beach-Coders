The Department of Health, EMS & Injury Prevention System Branch, collaborates with partners across the state to address the leading causes of injury that include: drowning prevention, fall prevention, poisoning prevention, suicide prevention, traffic safety, and violence and abuse prevention. For more information on each of these areas, click on the banner below. Injuries, a major public health problem in Hawaii (56 KB), are responsible for more deaths of children and young adults in Hawaii from age one through age 40 years than all other causes combined, including heart disease, stroke and cancer. Among residents of all ages, injury is the third leading cause of death, behind only heart disease and cancer, but ahead of cerebrovascular disease, influenza and pneumonia, and diabetes. The vast majority of injuries, however, are non-fatal and can lead to a range of outcomes, including temporary pain and inconvenience, disability, chronic pain, or a complete change in lifestyle. During an average week in Hawaii: 13 residents die from an injury 109 are hospitalized Nearly 1,600 are treated in emergency departments While the greatest impact of injury is in human suffering, the financial cost is staggering. In Hawaii, injury-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $390 million annually. To provide statewide leadership in preventing death and disability associated with injuries in Hawaii by educating, supporting and mobilizing individuals and organizations to incorporate comprehensive injury prevention strategies in their daily activities. The Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) is part of the Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention System Branch at the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH). IPCS is the focal point in the DOH for injury prevention throughout the state for all age groups. IPCS is responsible for coordinating, planning, conducting and evaluating injury prevention programs; developing policy; collecting, analyzing and disseminating injury data; and providing technical support and training. Much of IPCS’s work is achieved through community coalitions and partnerships that strive to increase and focus resources, minimize duplication of effort and support the injury prevention activities of local agencies and organizations. About the Core Competencies Every day, the work of the Hawaii Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section aims to encompass essential knowledge and skills that are widely considered necessary in the field of injury and violence prevention. These core competencie s (134KB) provide a basis for professional development and are intended to guide future training and curriculum development efforts. The Core Competencies of Injury & Violence Prevention Ability to describe and explain injury and/or violence as a major social and health problem.

May 2005. Available at https://www.safestates.org Traffic Safety – Fatalities among motor vehicle occupants is the fifth leading cause of fatal injury in Hawaii for all ages and the second leading cause of fatal injury among ages 1 to 34. Motor vehicle injuries also contribute to the second leading cause of injuries requiring hospitalization. Hawaii has the highest pedestrian fatality rate in the nation for older adults, and 16 out of 17 bicycle fatalities over the past 5 years involved a motor vehicle.

They are also the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the state with nearly 21,000 emergency room visits and 2,700 hospitalizations each year. More than three quarters of the victims are aged 65 or older and the risk of fatal falls increases dramatically as seniors get older. The emotional and fiscal burden associated with fall injuries is staggering. Read more… Drowning Prevention – Each week in Hawaii, at least one person fatally drowns. About one third of drownings occur in swimming pools. The majority of drownings in Hawaii are ocean-related, and half of those fatalities are among visitors. As an island state, it is essential that we create a safe environment and provide residents and visitors with information they need to have a safe and enjoyable experience in and around the water. Read more… Suicide Prevention – Suicide is the most common cause of fatal injuries among Hawaii residents. Over the five year period 2007-2011, 795 suicides accounted for almost one-quarter of all fatal injuries. The number of suicides for youth ages 15 to 24 surged from 15 in 2007 to 36 in 2011. It is the leading cause of injury-related death for most age groups – all but the very young and the very old – outpacing car crashes, homicide, poisoning and drowning. Read more… Poisoning Prevention – Poisoning among children has decreased with interventions such as childproof caps. However, the past few years death certificate and autopsy data have revealed dramatic increases in prescription drug overdoses. Partners from public and private sectors can all help reduce poisonings, especially prescription drug overdoses. Read more… Violence and Abuse Prevention – Violence and abuse can take many forms. They range from intimate partner violence, sexual assault, child maltreatment and elder abuse to bullying, school violence and hate crimes. These different forms of violence and abuse are often addressed independently even though they share common risk factors and prevention strategies.

Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan The Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan (HIPP), is a plan for injury prevention activities during the next five years. HIPP is a collaborative effort that reflects the current thinking of public health professionals and community partners in the following areas: Core capacity to sustain injury prevention policy and program activities Drowning Falls among older adults Poisoning Traffic-related injuries Suicide Violence and abuse IPCS worked closely with experts and stakeholders in each area to review accomplishments, conduct needs assessments, and develop recommendations for the next five years. Additional information about the processes used to generate these recommendations are included in the individual chapters. We are pleased to present you with the web-based Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan (HIPP) 2018-2023, that serves as a guide for reducing the eight leading causes of injury in Hawaii. This HIPP builds on the previous Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 and is the result of a collaborative effort between the Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH), Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention System Branch (EMSIPSB); the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC); and other community partners. In the gap period between the end of the previous plan and inception of the new plan, the initial plan continued to guide the work of the DOH Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) and community partners. The Hawaii State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS), with strong support from the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC), completed the Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan with funding from a Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention Program capacity building grant and a Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program grant, both from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).You can download and read the full Hawaii Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 (PDF 4Mb) . Databook: Injuries in Hawaii 2007-2011 Injuries in Hawaii 2007-2011 (“the Databook”) is a comprehensive report on the leading causes of injury mortality and morbidity in Hawaii. Injuries are a major public health problem in Hawaii. They are by far the leading cause of death among children and young adults, and the fourth leading cause of death among state residents of all ages. Over the 5-year period covered in this report, a total of 3,355 residents died from their injuries. More recently updated data summaries can be found in the injury-specific menu tabs . The information in this report is for health and safety professionals, policy makers, and for everyone interested in protecting and improving the health of the people of Hawaii. The report includes descriptions of the geography and magnitude of the problem, trends, and populations at higher risk, and provides insight into some of the circumstances of these injury fatalities. It is crucial that good data be available to guide prevention and policy efforts to reduce injuries in Hawaii. This report is a first step.

INJURY - A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM IN HAWAII  
 
Injuries are responsible for more deaths of children and young adults in Hawaii from age one 
through age 40 years than all other causes combined, including heart disease, stroke and 
cancer.  Among residents of all ages, injury is the fourth  leading cause o f death , behind only 
heart disease and cancer, but ahead of cerebrovascular disease, influenza and pneumonia, and 
diabetes .  Although the greatest impact of injury is in human suffering, the financial cost is 
staggering – in 2019 , medical treatment for inj uries generate d nearly  $670 million in hospital 
charges in Hawaii.    
 
Mortality statistics do not convey the full extent of the injury problem, however. Fatal injuries 
represent less than  1% of all injuries requiring medical attention. Although fatal injuries are the 
most severe, the great  majority of injuries are non -fatal, and in some respects, have much 
greater public health implications. On an average week in Hawaii 16 residents die fr om an 
injury, another 97 are hospitalized and another  1,805 are treated in emergency departments.   
 
Injuries, however, are not accidents. They are neither random nor uncontrollable.  Injuries are 
understandable, predictable and preventable.  The first ste p in understanding and preventing 
injuries is to collect and analyze data.  Answers to questions like “How serious is the problem?” , 
“Who has the problem?” and “What are the circumstances under which it occurs?” help 
determine the answers to questions such  as “What causes it?” and “What can we do about it?”

Dear Community Colleagues,
We are pleased to present you with the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 that serves as a guide
for reducing the eight leading causes of injury in Hawai‘i. This document builds on the previous Hawai‘i
Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 and is the result of a collaborative effort between the Hawai‘i State
Department of Health (DOH), Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention System Branch (EMSIPSB); the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC); and other community partners.  In thegap period between the end of the previous plan and inception of the new plan, the initial plan continuedto guide the work of the DOH Injury Prevention and Control Section and community partners.
Here in Hawai‘i, we have made great strides in preventing injuries through the cooperative efforts of
government agencies, voluntary and professional organizations, and numerous other communitypartners.  There is much more we must do, however, to further reduce the burden of injury. 
Injury prevention remains an under-recognized and under-funded area of public health.  Now more than
ever, we must leverage our resources to join the best knowledge and practices with strong partnerships toeffectively prevent injuries, thereby reducing pain and suffering, and saving Hawai‘i millions of dollarseach year.  We must work together to raise public awareness, build community capacity for injuryprevention efforts, make changes to the physical environment, and implement policy and organizationalpractices that prevent injuries.
On behalf of the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee and the Hawai‘i State Department of Health,
we invite you to join us in achieving the recommendations set forth in this plan.  Please contact us throughwww.nogethurthawaii.gov or call the Injury Prevention and Control Section on O‘ ahu at (808)733-9320. 
Working together, we can accomplish what none of us can do alone.

causes combined, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Among residents of all ages, injury is thefourth leading cause of death and disability.  The vast majority of injuries, however, are non-fatal andcan lead to a range of outcomes, including temporary pain and inconvenience, disability, chronic pain,or a complete change in lifestyle. 
During an average week in Hawai‘i: 
/UIforward13 residents die from an injury
/UIforward115 are hospitalized
/UIforwardNearly 1 ,530 are treated in emergency departments 
While the greatest impact of injury is in human suffering, the financial cost is staggering. In Hawai‘i, 
injury-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $364 million annually. Injury Prevention is a Public Health Priority in Hawai ‘i

support from the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC), completed the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention
Plan (HIPP) with funding from a Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention Program capacity
building grant and a Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program grant, both from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
The 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 , is a plan for injury prevention activities during the next
five years. Developed in collaboration with partners from across the state, the plan provides:
/UIforwardOverall direction and focus of IPCS and IPAC-led efforts 
/UIforwardStimulus for organizations, agencies and community groups to collaborate on reducing or preventing injuries in Hawai‘i
This report builds on the earlier, 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 (available online: 
www.nogethurt.hawaii.gov).  Details about the state’s progress toward meeting the objectives outlined in the 2005-2010 report can be found in the Appendix A.
HIPP is a collaborative effort that reflects the current thinking of public health professionals and
community partners in the following areas: 
/UIforwardCore capacity to sustain injury prevention policy and program activities
/UIforwardDrowning 
/UIforwardFalls among older adults
/UIforwardPoisoning
/UIforwardTraffic-related injuries
/UIforwardSuicide
/UIforwardViolence and abuse
IPCS worked closely with experts and stakeholders in each area to review accomplishments, conduct
needs assessments, and develop recommendations for the next five years.  Additional information aboutthe processes used to generate these recommendations are included in the individual chapters.Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan6 IntroductionThe Injury Prevention and Control Section is part of the Emergency Medical Services and Injury
Prevention System Branch at the Hawai‘i State Department of Health. IPCS is the focal point in theDepartment of Health for injury prevention throughout the state for all age groups.
IPCS is responsible for coordinating, planning, conducting, and evaluating injury prevention programs;
developing policy and coordinating advocacy; collecting, analyzing and disseminating injury data; andproviding technical support and training. Much of their work is achieved through community coalitionsand partnerships in order to increas e and focus community resources, minimize duplication of effort,
and support the injury prevention activities of local agencies and community organizations.  The Spectrumof Prevention is used as a guiding model for IPCS’s work to prevent injuries in Hawai‘i (see Appendix E).IPCS also provides staff support to IPAC.

Organizations and individuals interested in addressing a particular injury area can use HIPP forpriority setting and action planning. 
/UIforwardResearch
Researchers, including graduate and medical students, can use HIPP to develop studies to adapt and evaluate evidence-based practices for Hawai‘i.How the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan Can Be Used 8 Core CapacityPolicy and Program Activities
Background and Accomplishments
Since the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 was released, the Hawai‘i State Department 
of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has worked closely with partners in the community to build and strengthen the infrastructure to support injury prevention policy, research,surveillance and programs in Hawai‘i. 
/UIforwardWith the support of IPAC, IPCS added a suicide prevention coordinator to their staff and now has three permanent state-funded positions. 
/UIforwardComplete and accurate data are critical to assessing and understanding the injury problem, and also to developing and evaluating prevention programs. E-codes capture how an injury happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or intentional, such as suicide or assault), and the place where the event occurred.  IPCS led efforts to establish new standards for external cause of injury coding (e-coding) for hospitals to achieve and maintain.  Currently, 90% of all emergency department and hospital admission records meet the new standards, up from 51% in 2003.
/UIforwardIn collaboration with Kapiolani Community College, Emergency Services Department, IPCShelped to develop, implement and evaluate injury prevention training modules for the emergencymedical technician (EMT) program and mobile intensive care technician (MICT) program, and a continuing education module for emergency medical services personnel.
/UIforwardAiming to develop a cadre of individuals and organizations who are injury literate, articulate,and active, IPCS conducted public health competency building workshops and worked with affiliated injury prevention groups  to coordinate conferences specific to certain injuries. 
/UIforwardIn 2008, IPCS produced the Injuries in Hawai‘i 2001-2006, and disseminated the data report tostate legislators.  In partnership with IPAC, IPCS has worked to increase awareness among policymakers and residents of Hawai‘i about injuries as a major public health problem.  
/UIforwardIn 2008, IPCS released a series of “No Get Hurt” radio, television, and print ads with preventionmessages focused on different types of injuries that IPAC members helped to disseminate. 
/UIforwardRecognizing the significant percentage of Hawai‘i residents that are affiliated with the armedforces, IPCS has fostered partnerships with all five branches. There are military representativeson the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC) and the Prevent Suicide Hawai‘i SteeringCommittee, and the military actively participates in the annual “Click It or Ticket” traffic safety campaign. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention9 Core CapacityRecommendations
Building on work completed for the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 , IPCS and the 
IPAC steering committee developed the following recommendations.  They are based on the core components of a state injury prevention program as identified by the Safe States Alliance (2003):  
/UIforwardBuild a solid infrastructure for injury and violence prevention
/UIforwardCollect and analyze injury and violence data
/UIforwardDesign, implement, and evaluate programs
/UIforwardProvide technical support and training
/UIforwardAffect public policy
Recommendation 1: Build and sustain infrastructure to provide leadership, data, technical 
assistance, and to support policy and evaluation for advancing injury prevention
Hawai‘i needs a strong, stable, and comprehensive program to systematically address the many causes of injury in coordination with multiple partners.  “CDC recommends that states adopt a comprehensiveinjury prevention program to provide consistent, reliable and comprehensive data for policymakers;ensure high-risk populations are identified and helped; lead state efforts among programs with variousinjury prevention goals; and provide continuity amid changing administrations and budget priorities”(Foreman, 2009).
The enactment of the Trauma System Special Fund by the Hawai‘i State Legislature in 2007 
provided for the development of a comprehensive statewide trauma system by the Department ofHealth.  A comprehensive trauma system addresses the problem of injury along the full continuum from primary prevention through acute care and rehabilitation. 
As a core component of this system, injury prevention will be more closely integrated with other
strategies that can reduce the severity and outcomes of injuries and IPCS will have access to resources to support positions and injury prevention initiatives.  The new hospital trauma centers that are alsopart of the trauma system can play a critical role in injury prevention activities by coordinating andsupporting injury prevention interventions in their communities.
Some hospitals have already instituted injury prevention interventions (e.g., policies that require
staff to follow safe sleep recommendations with infants and ensure that newborns leave hospitals inappropriate safety seats).  The establishment of trauma centers would allow hospitals to expand theirroles in injury prevention within their organizations and the community. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention10 Core CapacityRecommended Next Steps
/UIforwardSecure core IPCS positions under the Trauma System Special Fund.  
/UIforwardBuild professional capacity of Neighbor Island community partners to coordinate
community-based injury prevention interventions through conference trainings and distance-based learning.
/UIforwardImplement county level injury prevention interventions in coordination with trauma center staff and community stakeholders. 
Recommendation 2: Serve as a clearinghouse for data, and incorporate other injury data sources to
strengthen analyses and further injury prevention efforts
The Safe States Alliance recommends injury prevention programs maintain a strong data componentwith access to major data sources that define the injury problem (2003).  Complete, accurate, andtimely data are critical to informing public policies, guiding the selection, design and evaluation of interventions, and directing use of limited resources. 
Hawai‘i needs to build on its impressive achievements by maintaining and further enhancing the 
collection and distribution of injury prevention data.
Recommended Next Steps 
/UIforwardMaintain and increase use of standards for e-coding by emergency departments and hospitals, and evaluate the completeness of collected data.
/UIforwardEnsure continued access to currently used databases. 
/UIforwardExpand access to data sources.
Work with the Medical Examiner's Office to institutionalize access to autopsy records.
Access and use data from the statewide Trauma Registry.
/UIforwardImprove accessibility of reliable and timely injury data to partners. 
Provide partners Hawai‘i Emergency Medical Services Information System (HEMSIS) data
about risk factors such as seat belt use, alcohol and drug use, and helmet use.
Utilize internet to increase accessibility of data to partners, decision makers, and the public. 
Improve ability to respond to data requests quickly and effectively.Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention11 Core CapacityRecommendation 3: Provide training and technical assistance to increase and enhance knowledge
and skills among injury prevention practitioners and partners 
In order to effectively address injuries in Hawai‘i, it will be essential to build injury prevention core competencies among practitioners in related fields.  Core competencies include the ability to(Runyan & Stephens Stidham, 2009):
/UIforwardDescribe injury and violence as a public health problem
/UIforwardAccess, interpret, use, and present injury and violence data
/UIforwardDesign, implement, and evaluate injury prevention activities
/UIforwardDisseminate injury prevention information to the community and key policy makers
/UIforwardAffect change through policy and education
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardConduct a needs assessment to understand the training needs of professionals and partners, 
including practitioners and organizations working in related fields (e.g., first responders ) or specific content areas (e.g., water safety), as well as interested members of the community. At the same time, determine where and how the different groups prefer to receive training.
/UIforwardBased on results from the assessment, develop trainings to strengthen injury prevention and public health core competencies. 
/UIforwardExplore opportunities to provide these trainings in settings that maximize available resources.  
Use existing venues (e.g., IPAC meetings, injury specific and public health conferences). 
Provide annual training to trauma center staff.
/UIforwardIdentify and prioritize professionals and organizations that can have the greatest impact in 
reducing injuries, and develop tailored trainings that address their needs and interests. 
/UIforwardProvide partners specific training in applying evidence-based practices to help integrate injuryprevention into their work. 
/UIforwardSupport and pursue resources for professional development of injury prevention staff. 
Recommendation 4: Cultivate awareness among decision makers and the public to elevate injury
and violence as a major public health problem in Hawai ‘i
Injury prevention researchers, practitioners and advocates understand that injuries are a leading cause of death and disability that can be prevented.  Many decision makers and members of the public, however, continue to think of injuries as accidents that are unavoidable. 
It is imperative to communicate the personal and financial costs of injury as well as the potential 
solutions in order to inform policies, secure resources, change behaviors, and affect injury rates inHawai‘i.  Injury prevention advocates need to work with partners and the media to reach target audiences with carefully developed and tested messages.  Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention12 Core CapacityRecommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDevelop, test and disseminate injury prevention messages that are tailored to specific, 
prioritized audiences.
Disseminate messages developed by IPCS and the Fall Prevention Consortium (with training
and support from CDC's Injury Center Communications Initiative).  Identify and use commu-nication channels most frequently accessed and trusted by target audiences. 

Apply this message development process to other injury areas to create, test and disseminate 
additional messages.
/UIforwardDevelop materials that educate specific audiences, such as policy makers or employers, about 
priority injury areas.
/UIforwardSeek opportunities to communicate with the media about current issues, using relevant data andconsistent prevention messages. 
/UIforwardFacilitate partners’ ability to effectively communicate about injury by regularly providing current data and   information about evidence-based prevention strategies.
Use existing communication channels such as IPAC meetings and newsletters.
Recommendation 5: Inform injury prevention policy at all levels
Evidence-based policies implemented at national, state, local, and agency or organizational 
levels can dramatically reduce the burden of injury.  State legislation that requires children to ride in safety seats, local ordinances that require pool fencing, and health care provider policies that recommend fall risk assessments for all older clients are examples of policies that can help reduce injuries.

/UIforwardContinue to identify, track, and share information about annual legislative injury prevention priorities. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention13 Injury Specific RecommendationsCore Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention
Recommendation 6: Increase opportunities for collaborative injury prevention efforts in all priority 
injury prevention areas
Working collaboratively with partners from diverse disciplines, organizations, and perspectives inside and outside of state government is critical to success.  To optimize the best use of limited resources, injury prevention partners need to coordinate efforts and address critical concerns without duplicating their efforts. 
Partnerships have been essential to the work of IPCS, as evidenced throughout this report.  They are
critical to directing priorities, communicating messages, and sustaining programs.

Background and Accomplishments
Drowning prevention has been a priority issue for the Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury 
Prevention and Cont rol Section (IPCS) since 1991 . H awai‘i has accomplished much in the area of
drowning prevention with the  bene fits of highly engaged experts, exceptional ocean safety officers 
across the state, active involvement from the visitor industry, and strong collaborative partnerships in the community. 
/UIforwardThe Hawai‘i Beach Safety website (www.hawaiibeachsafety.org) was developed in 2006 and provides beach ratings based on comprehensive risk assessments that were conducted on allguarded and unguarded beaches in the state.  The site also features safety information about hazards (e.g., rip currents, dangerous shore breaks), prevention tips, surf reports, special alerts(e.g., box jelly fish notices), and warnings. Information on the website is updated several timeseach day. Partners on this project include the Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services Division at the City and County of Honolulu, the Hawaiian Lifeguard Association, ocean safety and lifeguard partners on neighbor islands, the University of Hawai‘i School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority, and the Hawai‘i State Department of Health. 
/UIforwardIn collaboration with the Hawai‘i Association of Independent Schools, IPCS co-produced thevideo, “Be Ocean Minded” about the Junior Lifeguard Program. Lifeguards    from all islands were interviewed to talk about ocean safety, prevention tips, and the value of the Junior Lifeguard Program.  The county-based Junior Lifeguard Program runs during the summer and trains teenagers (13-17 years of age) in ocean skills, beach condition assessment, and lifesaving techniques. The video serves as a recruitment tool for the program and copies have been distributed across the state.
/UIforwardIn 2009, IPCS surveyed over 500 beach goers on O‘ ahu, both residents and visitors, to assess the impact of four types of beach warning signs: strong current, high surf, dangerous shorebreak, and waves breaking on ledge. Results showed that about half of those surveyed saw the signs, and among those, 66% thought the signs would influence their behavior.
/UIforwardIPCS worked with the Swimming Pool Association of Hawai‘i in 2009 to conduct a survey of1 ,300 residential pool owners on O‘ ahu.  The impetus for this project was to inform pool ownersabout a federal law designed to protect children against entrapment from the suction of pooldrains and pumps. This 2009 law, the Virginia Graeme-Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, ismandatory for commercial pools but not for residential pools.  The survey asked about drain covers and pumps as well as fencing, safety latches on gates, whether there were kids in theirhome and if so, whether the kids participated in swimming lessons.  Pool owners also were provided with pool safety and entrapment prevention information.  A follow-up survey determined what safety changes pool owners made.  During the survey, 163 swimming pools or spas were identified as having potentially dangerous equipment; 65 pool owners voluntarily upgraded their pumps and drains. 15 Injury Specific RecommendationsDrowning Prevention
Recommendations
In 2010, IPCS led a statewide needs assessment that included 
a review of best practices for drowning prevention, in-depthtelephone interviews with ten key stakeholders (i.e., represen-tatives of organizations involved in prevention efforts, and potential partners), and two strategic planning sessions withpartners from the community and the visitor industry.  IPCSused the information gathered through this process to developand prioritize the following recommendations. 
Recommendation 1: Establish a task force to develop a
statewide approach to drowning prevention
Each week in Hawai‘i, at least one person fatally drowns.  As anisland state, it is essential that we c reate a safer environment
and provide residents and tourists with information they needto have a safe and enjoyable experience in and around the water.
A statewide task force for drowning prevention would bring keypartners together to coordinate drowning prevention efforts,and provide guidance to IPCS moving forward. Partners in thecommunity, including the visitor industry should be broadly
represented on the task force, and efforts should be made to engage educators. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardWork with existing groups, including the Hawai‘i  Department of Land and Natural Resources and the
Hawaiian Lifeguard A ssociation to create a task force, 
build membership and define a clear mission.
Recommendation 2: Implement a statewide educational 
campaign to increase ocean safety awareness among residents
and visitors
The majority of drownings in Hawai‘i are ocean-related, and half of those fatalities are among tourists.  Clear and effectivemessages for resi dents and visitors of Hawai‘i need to be 
developed, tested, implemented, and evaluated.  Messages may be communicated through existing communication channels, including the Hawai‘i Beach Safety website and the Hawai‘iTourism Authority’s Travel Smart Hawai‘i website.  Effortsshould be made to engage partners throughout the message development and dissemination process. PARTNERS

Attention also must be paid to visitors’ sources of information. Hawai‘i guidebooks are of particular 
concern as they often direct visitors who are less familiar with ocean swimming and conditions to unguarded locations without explaining the potential dangers. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardSolicit partner input to develop and test clear, consistent prevention messages for visitors 
and residents.
/UIforwardEngage partners in message dissemination and evaluation.
/UIforwardEducate writers and publishers of guidebooks about drownings in H awai‘i and encourage them 
to include accurate information in their publications about safety conditions.
Recommendation 3: Evaluate current drowning prevention efforts and disseminate information about
best practices
Drowning prevention is a complex public health concern. There are numerous factors including theage and ability of the individual, the body of water (e.g., swimming pool, ocean, stream), and currentconditions (Quan, et al, 2007). More information is needed about what works to prevent drowning in Hawai‘i. 
Currently, there aren’t many evidence-based strategies or best practices to prevent drowning. There
are several promising practices that have strong behavioral elements, and very few environmental orlegislative interventions.  More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions andeducation materials currently in use (Quan, et al, 2007). Results from such research would help solicitsupport from partners and policy makers, and inform decisions about resource allocation. 
Equally important to completing the research will be disseminating information about best and promising
practices to key audiences in the state as well as the broader drowning prevention community. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardEvaluate the Hawai‘i Beach Safety website, www.hawaiibeachsafety.org, to determine effectiveness and use
of the site.
/UIforwardProvide data support and technical assistance to practitioners that need assistance evaluating theirown drowning prevention programs. 
/UIforwardEvaluate effectiveness of safety efforts, including the provision of rescue tubes, at unguarded beaches across the state.

Injury Data for Drownings (residents and non-residents)
Fatal injuries
There was no clear trend in the annual number of drownings, although the 79 deaths in 2011 was 
the highest total since at least 1993.  Most of the high total in 2011 was due to drownings on Honoluluand Maui counties. About half (53%) of the victims were Hawai‘i residents, 36% from the U.S. mainland,and 12% from foreign countries.  The ages of the victims were widely distributed, although only 8%were under 18 years of age.  Almost all (83%) were males.  About half (47%) of all the victims drownedon O‘ ahu .  If only drownings among Hawai‘i residents were considered, O‘ ahu residents had the lowest rates, significantly lower than rates for Neighbor Island residents as a whole.  If non-residentsare also included, the highest (unadjusted) rate was computed for Kaua‘i, approximately twice ashigh as rates for Hawai‘i County and more than 3 times the rates for Honolulu County (the island of O‘ ahu).  
Most (78%, or 259) of the victims drowned in the ocean or saltwater environments, almost all of 
whom (96%) were 18 years or older.  Unintentional immersions led to 13% of these drownings, including 31 victims who fell in or were swept into the ocean.  Other common activities were swimming (29% of victims), snorkeling (22%), and free diving (9%).  According to autopsy records, intrinsic or personal factors contributed to over half (61%) of the saltwater drownings in HonoluluCounty from 2007 to 2010.  The most common intrinsic factor was circulatory diseases, presentamong 46% of the victims of all ages, and 69% of those aged 50 years and older.  Only 13% of the victims tested positive for alcohol, and only 7% had BAC (blood alcohol content) levels of 0.08% orgreater.  Illicit drug use was considered a contribution to 12% of the drownings.  Apart from oceandrownings, there were 36 drownings in swimming pools, 21 in rivers and streams, and 12 in bathtubs.  Only 3 (8%) of the 36 victims who drowned in swimming pools were under 5 years of age, as victim age was widely distributed in this environment.  Trend: no trend

Nonfatal injuries (near drownings)
There was no clear trend in the annual number of near drownings, which averaged 235 per year.
Hawai‘i residents comprised a slight majority (55%) of all patients treated for near drownings, butonly 41% of those who were hospitalized.  ED (emergency  department) patients were significantlyyounger on average than those who were hospitalized (31 vs. 40 years of age), with more than half(56%) in the 15 to 44 year age group.  Among Hawai‘i residents, county-specific rate estimates weregenerally comparable except for Hawai‘i and Maui county residents.  
Hospitalizations were of a relatively short number of days (4. 1 , on average), but because each 
hospitalization incurred over $28,000 in charges, they comprised most (91%) of the total $2.3 millionin annual medical charges related to drowning.  Swimming (40%) and “surfing, windsurfing andboogie boarding” (32%) were the most common activities for the patients overall, although swimmingwas a more likely cause among non-residents (45%), while the latter activities were more commonamong residents (39%).  
EMS data
Almost all (94%) of the incidents EMS responded to occurred during day time hours, including 80%between 9:31 a.m. and 5:29 p.m.  More than half (59%) of the patients were Hawai‘i residents.  About43% of the near drownings occurred in bodies of water, which could include both freshwater andsaltwater environments.  About one-third (30%) were in patient residences (10%), public buildings(12%), hotels (5%), and health care facilities (3%).  Most (77%) of the patients were either transportedin “serious” (46%) or “ critical” (32%) condition, with no significant differences in the distribution ofpatient condition between residents and non-residents.  Probable alcohol use was noted for only 4%of the patients.  Near drownings  that occurred during night time hours were significantly morelikely to involve alcohol consumption than day time incidents, however (21% vs. 3%).  
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Only 8% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry  near drowning patients
were positive for alcohol, and only 9% tested positive for illicit drugs, although there was no toxico-logical testing for about two-thirds of the patients.  Substance use was somewhat higher among resident patients, although this comparison is limited by the small sample sizes and the lack of testing.Trend: no trend

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has been
working with partners in the community to prevent falls among older adults for nearly a decade. 
/UIforwardIn 2003, IPCS supported the establishment of the Hawai‘i Fall Prevention Consortium 
which provides a forum for information sharing, collaboration on fall prevention activities, and promotion of best practices for reducing falls among older adults.  Members represent government agencies, professional associations, non-profit organizations, hospitals, care facilities, and senior organizations. 
/UIforwardStatewide conferences on fall prevention, held in 2005 and 2007, featured nationally recognizedleaders in the field.
/UIforwardIn 2009, a Tai Chi for Health intervention was successfully piloted at Pohai Nani Care Facility.IPCS sponsored a similar intervention at Leahi Hospital in 2011 .
/UIforwardEducational materials were developed and distributed to raise awareness about fall preventionand fall prevention information, including a fall prevention directory of services and resources,was added to the state injury prevention website www.nogethurt.hawaii.gov.  
/UIforwardIn partnership with the Fall Prevention Consortium, IPCS facilitated fall prevention screening for balance by physical and occupational therapists and medication reviews by pharmacistsstatewide as part of annual fall prevention awareness activities.
/UIforwardThe State Executive Office on Aging and county Area Agencies on Aging used data collected byIPCS to inform their 2011-2015 State and Area Plans on Aging.  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , the Executive Office on Aging and IPCS partnered to establish the Hawai‘i State Fall Prevention Task Force.  This short-term, volunteer Task Force comprised of key stakeholders isdeveloping a comprehensive statewide approach to fall prevention by December 2012 that willaddress recommendations in this report.
/UIforwardThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) selected IPCS as one of three states to participate in an injury prevention message development and framing initiative.  In 2010, IPCS,members of the Fall Prevention Consortium, and other community partners engaged in training to develop a coordinated communication strategy for fall prevention.  Participants developed messages for independent older adults that IPCS tested, and the Fall Prevention Consortium is coordinating final revisions and dissemination.20 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Recommendations
In 2010, a statewide needs assessment was conducted that 
included a literature review, an online survey of more than 200 fall prevention professionals and community members,and follow-up telephone interviews with 58 key informants.IPCS, together with the Fall Prevention Consortium and other partners, used the results from this needs assessment as thebasis for the following recommendations.  
Recommendation 1: Raise awareness about fall prevention
among older adults, caregivers, and providers
Enhance awareness among the public, older adults, caregivers,and providers that falls can be prevented and promote adoptionof four key prevention behaviors:
/UIforwardBeginning a regular exercise program 
/UIforwardHaving one’s health care provider review medicines
/UIforwardHaving one’s vision checked
/UIforwardMaking one's home safer
The scientific literature and the June 2010 survey of key 
informants in Hawai‘i confirmed that many older adults areunaware of their increased risk of falling or the simple stepsthey can take to reduce their risk (World Health Organization(WHO), 2007).
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDisseminate previously developed and tested messages 
for older adults.
/UIforwardDevelop and test additional clear, audience-specific mes-sages for care givers, pharmacists, and physicians.
/UIforwardIdentify and use appropriate communication channels toreach key audiences.
/UIforwardDistribute messages through community partners, including Fall Prevention Consortium members.
/UIforwardDevelop a packet of fall prevention educational materials tobe distributed through partners.PARTNERS

Recommendation 2: Increase availability and accessibility of fall prevention programs statewide
Fall prevention programs can help older adults:
/UIforwardAssess balance and strength
/UIforwardExercise to increase their strength and balance
/UIforwardGet their medications reviewed and adjusted at least annually
/UIforwardAssess and modify their homes to reduce fall hazards 
/UIforwardCheck for and correct vision impairments
The scientific literature has shown these activities can reduce the risk of falling, and there are various
fall prevention programs available in the state (WHO, 2007).  These programs are not, however, availableacross all islands and in all communities. In addition, these services are not always covered by insurance;for example, Medicare does not pay for eye glasses.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardExpand exercise programs tailored to increase balance and strength such as Enhanced Fitness, 
Tai Chi, and No Fear of Falling. 
/UIforwardIncrease the availability and use of successful home safety assessment programs. 
/UIforwardDevelop strategies to coordinate services among venues where older adults gather, such as community clinics, senior centers, meal sites, senior housing, assisted living facilities, care homes, day health centers, shopping centers, schools, and churches.
/UIforwardDevelop and disseminate an updated fall prevention resource guide to supplement current materialsproduced by the Area Agencies on Aging and the Adult Disability Resources Centers (ADRC). 
/UIforwardExplore resources to print translations of educational materials.  Languages might include Ilocano,Tagalog, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean.
Recommendation 3: Engage professionals and community members in fall prevention activities
Develop fall prevention activities that engage: 
/UIforwardPublic workers (e.g., paramedics, fire fighters, public health nurses, Area Agency on Aging staff)
/UIforwardHealth care providers, elder care providers, ADRC staff members, program trainers (e.g., physicians,nurses, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacists)
/UIforwardCoalitions (e.g., Fall Prevention Consortium, the Hawai‘i Healthy Aging Program)
/UIforwardNon-profit organizations (e.g., AARP, YMCA)
/UIforwardInterested individuals (e.g., retired workers, volunteers)
Many individuals and organizations must join together to prevent falls in Hawai‘i.  Already, paramedics
and some pharmacists provide medication reviews, and many hospitals and rehabilitation programs assist with home assessments and modifications.  But more individuals and organizations can, andshould be enlisted in the cause. 22 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Recommended Next Steps
Develop mutually beneficial partnerships with groups to facilitate fall prevention activities, for example:
/UIforwardEncourage community partners, such as fire departments and EMS providers to assist with 
home assessments.
/UIforwardEnable more pharmacists and other qualified professionals to provide free annual medication reviews.
/UIforwardEncourage medical professionals to provide fall risk assessments.
/UIforwardTrain care home providers to lead exercise programs for their residents. 
/UIforwardEngage and support students in professional schools by:
Training occupational and physical therapy assistants to certify eldercare providers 
in senior-friendly exercise programs.
Enlisting medical and pharmacy students to assist with medication reviews.
Training nurses, certified nurse aid students, and certified medical assistants in 
home assessment.
/UIforwardWork with partners to develop and implement a training program and tool kit to educate all healthcare providers about the special needs of older adults and fall prevention strategies.
/UIforwardEngage new and current members of the Fall Prevention Consortium, including representativesfrom the Aging Network, to achieve identified priorities. 
Injury Data for Falls
Fatal injuries
Falls were the most common type of fatal unintentional injury in the state, with the 541 deaths accounting for 25% of the total.  More than three-quarters (79%) of the victims were aged 65 years orolder, and the risk of fatal falls increased dramatically across the senior age range.  Males comprisedthe majority (78%) of victims under 65 years of age, while gender was more equally distributed forthe senior-aged victims.  Honolulu County residentscomprised most of the victims of all ages (77%)and those who were 65 years or older (81%).  The fall fatality rate estimate for senior-aged residentsof Honolulu County was significantly higher than the rates for residents of Kaua‘i or Maui counties,and 45% higher than for Neighbor Island residents considered as a whole.

F23 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Death certificates provided little information on the causes of falls, as most were coded as “falls on the
same level” with no further description (48%), or “unspecified” causes (32%).  Falls from stairs or steps
were the most specifically coded cause, but comprised only 4% of the total.  More than half (61%) of the
falls occurred at the residence of the victim, including 68% of the senior-aged victims.  
Nonfatal injuries
Falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injuries among Hawai‘i residents, with nearly 21 ,000 ED(emergency department) visits and over 2,700 hospitalizations each year.  The annual number of injuries generally increased.  Children aged 1 to 14 years comprised 27% of all patients, but abouttwo-thirds (68%) of those who were hospitalized were 65 years or older.  Gender was equally distributedamong patients treated in EDs, but females comprised 59% of the patients that were hospitalized. 
Residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal injuries from falls
than residents of Honolulu and Maui counties.  The residents of Honolulu County had the lowestrates of hospitalizations. Among the more specifically coded injuries, the most common causes werefalls from stairs, steps and escalators (5.3% of the total), beds (3.7%), skateboards (3.5%), and chairs,playground equipment, and ladders (about 2% for each).  At least half (53%) of the falls that causedhospitalizations in seniors occurred in home environments.  This proportion increases to 84% if onlyrecords with specific information on location are considered.  The most common activity related tothe falls was “walking, marching and hiking”, accounting for 30% of the total.  Skateboarding, running,tackle football, and bathing and showering were also prominent activities.  Hospitalizations averagednearly 1 week in duration, resulted in over $31 ,000 in medical charges, and accounted for 72% ($84million) of the total annual charges of $116.6 million related to falls.  Fractures were present innearly three-fourths (74%) of the hospitalized patients, including 29% with hip fractures.  Trend: increasing trend

Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Only 11% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry resident patients who were
injured by falls were positive for alcohol, with 4 times higher use among patients in the 18 to 64 yearage group (19%), compared to senior-aged patients (5%).  Fifteen percent of the patients tested positivefor illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (11%).  Considered together, about one-quarter (24%, or

lower among the senior-aged patients (13%), compared to younger patients (36%).  
24 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults25 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has collaborated
with partners to address different types of poisonings among different populations.
/UIforwardIPCS strongly supports the Keiki Injury Prevention Coalition (KIPC) in their ongoing efforts to 
prevent poisoning. 
In 2009, KIPC received a grant from the Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture related to the 
recognition and management of pesticide-related injuries.  KIPC has conducted poisoning prevention education and outreach activities for the public to increase awareness of householdpesticide exposures and reduce exposures in and around households.
KIPC works to raise public awareness about, and increase use of, the 24 hour Hawai‘i poison 
control hotline for information about potential poisonings and medications.   
/UIforwardIn 2010, IPCS began serving as a clearinghouse to disseminate poisoning prevention materials tocommunity partners.  Materials disseminated to pediatricians, preschools, hospitals, and health care clinics on all islands include magnets and stickers to promote the Hawai‘i poison control hotline, poisoning prevention information fact sheets,  “No Get Hurt” poisoning prevention posters,and information on the correct use of pesticides from the Department of Agriculture.
As part of the “No Get Hurt” campaign, IPCS printed poisoning prevention posters in 2010 for 
use by the Department of Health Women Infant and Children (WIC) Services Branch and othercommunity partners.
/UIforwardIPCS collaborated with a community partner to analyze data about poisonings from opioids inHonolulu County between 2004-2008.  The results of this analysis showed the most common way to access opiates was through a personal prescription (46% of the victims).  Only a minority of victimsaccessed opiates through prescriptions written for other people (4%), or purchased drugs illicitly(4%). However, access to opiates was not known for a large proportion (41%) of the victims, limitingthe reliability of this data source.
/UIforwardIn 1992, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) established Hawai‘i’s Prescription Drug Monitoring System (PDM) - one of the best practices for determining misuse and abuse of controlled substances. In 2012, improvements were made to the program to ensure the PDM database is effectively used and maintained. In addition to maintaining the PDM system, DPS is required to “ carry out educational programs designed to prevent and determine misuse and abuse of controlled substances” (HRS 329-58).  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , IPCS began collaborating with state and community organizations working on STD/AIDS and substance
abuse prevention in an effort to understand and address the 
increase in prescription drug overdoses. 26 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
Recommendations
While poisoning among children has decreased with interventions such as childproof caps, the past few
years have revealed dramatic increases in prescription drug overdoses (CDC, 2011b). IPCS analyzedtrend data for poisoning fatalities and injuries, including prescription drug overdoses, and conducted a comprehensive review of current best practices. Results from this analysis formed the basis for the recommendations below. 
IPCS first presented results of the analysis to the Department of Health, STD/AIDS Prevention
Branch and the CHOW Project (The Community Health Outreach Work to Prevent AIDS Project), which were subsequently shared with the Hawai‘i Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and 
Controlled Substances (HACDACS).  As set forth by the Legislature, HACDACS is the primary advisory body to the Departments of Public Safety and Health and to the Legislature, and an appropriate partner to support in developing policy changes for the prevention of prescription drug overdoses.
Partners from public and private sectors (e.g., public safety, insurance, medicine, pharmacology, 
substance abuse treatment, law enforcement) can all help reduce poisonings, especially prescriptiondrug overdoses, in Hawai‘i.
Recommendation 1: Enhance use of data resources to understand the problem of prescription drug
overdoses in Hawai ‘i and facilitate prevention efforts
To better address the issue of prescription drug overdoses, more data and analyses are necessary.Death certificates describe an overall increasing trend but provide limited data on the type of drugscausing deaths. Autopsy data provides more information about deaths due to prescription drugs, including the specific substances involved and whether victims accessed drugs through legal or illegal means, although information about access is missing from a significant proportion of autopsyrecords.  Therefore, linking autopsy data with the PDM database would help describe access to thespecific substances involved in overdoses and provide a clearer picture of drug overdose fatalities in Hawai‘i. 
Additional data sources such as survey-based data and fatality reviews that go beyond information
gathered for autopsy reviews, would add to the body of knowledge about prescription drug use andpractices, and help identify risk factors and effective prevention measures. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDetermine ability to gain access to the Department of Public Safety’s PDM database and other state
agencies' data related to drug poisoning (Medicaid, workers’ compensation data).
/UIforwardLink death certificate and autopsy records with the PDM database to learn more about decedents’ access to drugs.
/UIforwardUse additional data sources to describe general drug use and poisoning in the population and indicate areas for further research (i.e., Hawai‘i Health Information Center, Trauma Registry, Poison Center Data, Behavioral Risk Factor System Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey).27 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
/UIforwardProvide comprehensive data and injury prevention expertise to support partnerships and strategies
for addressing prescription drug overdoses.  Key partners include:
The Hawai‘i Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and Controlled Substances
Hawai‘i State Department of Health Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division
Hawai‘i State Department of Health STD/AIDs Branch
The CHOW Project (The Community Health Outreach Work to Prevent AIDS Project)
Hawai‘i Substance Abuse Coalition
Hawai‘i State Department of Public Safety
Hospitals and trauma centers
First responders 
County police departments
Physicians and pharmacists
Insurance companies
Community organizations
Recommendation 2:  Identify and support enactment of policies and practices that reduce both 
inappropriate and illegal prescribing, and evaluate their effectiveness
Promising policies and practices target the prescribing practices of health care providers to help preventprescription drug abuses and overdoses while allowing safe and effective pain management.  These include prescription drug monitoring programs, patient review and restriction programs, health careprovider accountability, laws and education to prevent prescription drug abuse and diversion, and better access to substance abuse treatment, including risk reduction strategies and education.  Increasing capacity of pharmacists and other prescribers to educate patients about overdose can alsoleverage prevention efforts.  These interventions need to be evaluated locally to determine their effectiveness in reducing prescription drug overdose deaths (CDC, 2011b).   
States play key roles in regulating the use of prescription drugs and the practices of prescribers and pharmacists, and in financing and regulating health care for people with Medicaid - a group at greater risk for overdose (CDC, 2011a).
State agencies need to work in partnership with organizations in the private sector from health care andrelated fields to bring about changes in organizational practices.  Implementing screening and briefintervention  and ref erral and treatment pr otocols in state-funded trauma centers, and adding screening
for potential misuse and abuse of prescription drugs can serve as a model practice for other hospitals andhealth care systems to adopt.  As important potential users of the PDM database, emergency physiciansare one of the key partners in prescription drug overdose prevention efforts.  28 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention

/UIforwardSupport risk reduction training for first responders, health care providers, and other serviceproviders to reduce the risk of death from opioid overdoses.
Recommendation 3: Support primary poisoning prevention education and maintenance of the 
poison information hotline
Poisoning prevention education and the poison information hotline encourage appropriate actions thatcan reduce poisoning injuries, fatalities, and their associated hospital and health care costs.  In additionto responding to calls for diagnostic or treatment recommendations on poison exposure for which callerswould otherwise go to the emergency department, health care providers rely on the hotline for toxicologyexpertise in handling severe overdoses.  The poison hotline also identifies and alerts the public to poisoningtrends, and provides a drug identification service to callers that reduces drug errors from improper useof medications. 
Recommended Next Steps

Injury Data for Poisonings
Fatal injuries
There was an increasing trend in the annual number of unintentional poisonings.  (There was no
consistent trend in the number of poisonings of undetermined intent over this period.)  Victim agewas narrowly distributed, as 58% were in the 45 to 64 year age range.  Males comprised 78% of the victims.  Most (82%) of the victims were poisoned on O‘ ahu, and the highest fatality rates were computed for Honolulu County residents.  Inclusion of poisonings of undetermined intent resulted in significantly lower rates among O‘ ahu residents compared to Hawai‘i or Maui county residents, so these comparisons are unreliable.  Drugs caused almost all (93%) of the poisonings, including 32% from “narcotics and hallucinogens” and 34% from “sedative-hypnotic and psychotropic drugs”.

There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal poisonings, but this was evident only for 
ED (emergency department) visits among Honolulu and Maui county residents.  Gender was nearlyequally distributed with 53% male patients.  Patient age was broadly distributed, although one-quarter (26%) were 1 to 14 years of age.  Seniors comprised only 13% of all patients, but (23%) ofthose who were hospitalized.  Rates of ED visits were highest by far for residents under 5 years of age, nearly 5 times higher than the rate for all other age groups.  Residents of Honolulu and Mauicounties had comparable injury rates, significantly lower than the rates for residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties. 
Patients were hospitalized for slightly over 3 days on average, with nearly $18,000 in medical charges 
related to poisoning.  Most (76%) of the poisonings were caused by drugs or medicinal substances,including 92% of those that required hospitalization.  Narcotics caused 21% of the hospitalizations,tranquilizers 13%, aromatic analgesics (which include acetaminophen, or Tylenol) 8%, and cardiovascular agents 8%.  Poisoning Prevention

The Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has led suicide prevention activities within the
Hawai‘i State Department of Health since 2005 with support from the Child and Adolescent MentalHealth Division, the Adult Mental Health Division, and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division.
/UIforwardThe Prevent Suicide Hawai‘i Task Force (PSHTF) has chapters in each county and includes morethan 100 members representing a broad network of agencies and stakeholders.  PSHTF providesguidance to IPCS related to suicide prevention programming and activities.  PSHTF grew out of the
Suicide Prevention Task Force that was initiated in 2000 by the Department of Health, Maternal and Child Health Branch.
/UIforwardIn 2006, IPCS secured funds for a permanent suicide prevention coordinator to lead and implementinitiatives based on the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the Hawai‘i State Plan for Suicide Prevention. 
/UIforwardWith an established PSHTF and suicide prevention coordinator, suicide prevention gatekeepertrainings began to be offered statewide to representatives from health and human services, education,emergency services, faith-based organizations and the general public.  Trainings included:
ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) – a two-day intensive training 
program to help participants identify and assess the risk of individuals in crisis and provide
early intervention and referral to reduce the risk.
safeTALK – a three hour suicide intervention training that prepares participants to identify 
persons with thoughts of suicide and connect them to suicide prevention first aid resources.
/UIforwardIn 2007, legislation was passed to support a youth prevention program with $100,000 annually.IPCS used these funds, in collaboration with PSHTF, to build a statewide network of public andcommunity partnerships with task forces on each island, to build public awareness and to increaseprofessional and community capacity for responding to individuals at risk for suicide through gatekeeper training. 
/UIforwardIn 2008, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration awarded IPCS fundingthrough the Garrett Lee Smith grant. The 3-year federal award provided $500,000 annually tosupport continued implementation and evaluation of ASIST and safeTALK trainings and a pilot ofthe Signs of Suicide training for t eachers and students.  These gatekeeper trainings focused on youth,
partnering with three agencies: Honolulu Police Department; Department of Education; Departmentof Health, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division.  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , the Sustainability Plan for Suicide Prevention Training in Hawai‘i was developed to 
address gatekeeper training needs for the future.  The plan was built on previous efforts and community partnerships.  
Recommendations
The following recommendations were informed by a needs assessment of 500 key stakeholders, includingPSHTF members, ASIST trainers and other partners, and additional input was provided by PSHTF sub-committee chairs. IPCS, together with the PSHTF and other partners, agreed to continue expanding effortshighlighted in the 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 . The national Suicide Prevention Resource
Center supports these recommendations. Suicide Prevention32 Injury Specific RecommendationsSuicide Prevention
Recommendation 1:  Enhance ongoing suicide prevention trainings for gatekeepers
A “gatekeeper” can be any individual who interacts with others at work, in schools, at play, at home, or 
in community settings (i.e., other than clinical settings).  Gatekeepers trained in suicide prevention and
intervention learn to:
/UIforwardRecognize early signs of suicidal behavior
/UIforwardImplement timely and effective intervention strategies
/UIforwardIdentify opportunities to reinforce protective factors
/UIforwardIntervene in crisis situations
/UIforwardRefer people to appropriate professionals, or “ open the gate” to mental health services
Training gatekeepers is considered a best practice among suicide prevention professionals. Evaluation of
ASIST trainings has described positive gains in trainees’ self-rated capacity to identify, assess, and referpotentially suicidal people, both immediately after the ASIST training, and approximately one year after.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardContinue evaluation of gatekeeper training programs to determine which approaches are most 
effective across different settings.
/UIforwardContinue providing culturally competent trainings to increase the number of gatekeepers in thecommunity.
Specific attention should be paid to training gatekeepers that reach underserved populations, 
including youth, seniors, the homeless, those who are incarcerated, adults with mental healthchallenges, and ind ividuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered.

Recommendation 2: Develop and implement a public awareness campaign
The stigma associated with suicide has been recognized as a barrier to treatment for many people who are having suicidal thoughts or who have made previous suicide attempts. Lives can be savedthrough public understanding that suicides are preventable and that individuals and groups can play a significant role in suicide prevention.
A statewide public awareness campaign would aim to increase awareness about suicide as a serious
public health problem, dispel myths, and decrease stigma related to suicide.  Messages and materialswould support a shift in beliefs, promote help-seeking behavior, and publicize available prevention, intervention, and aftercare services in the community.

Injury Data for Suicides and suicide attempts
Fatal injuries
There was a generally increasing trend in the number of suicides in the state, and the 195 deaths in 2010was by far the highest total in the 21-year period (1991-2011) for which data was available.  Victimage was widely distributed, although almost all (95%) were 19 years or older.  The highest fatalityrates were computed for residents aged 45 to 54 years and those 85 years and older.  Male victimsoutnumbered females by approximately 3-to-1 .  More than half (58%) of the victims were residents ofO‘ ahu, but the fatality rate for O‘ ahu (58/100,000 residents) was significantly lower than the rate for thecombined Neighbor Islands (94/100,000).  
The most common mechanism was by hanging or suffocation (49% of the suicides), followed by
firearm use (20%).  Most (65%) of the O‘ ahu victims had a documented history of mental illness (asvariously defined), according to autopsy records from 2007 to 2010.  The most common negative lifeevents for the victims were related to intimate relationship problems (34%), usually a break-up or divorce (12%), or serious illness or medical issues (26%).  The latter was documented for 60% of thesenior-aged victims.  Over one-third (37%) had a history of substance abuse, 19% had a BAC  (bloodalcohol content) level over 0.08%, and 34% tested positive for illicit drugs.  Nearly one-third (32%) ofthe victims had a previous suicide attempt documented in the record, and more than half (56%) hadverbally threatened suicide.  Trend: increasing

Nonfatal injuries
There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal suicide attempts, which was only evident in 
the annual number of injuries that were treated in EDs (emergency departments).  Slightly morethan half (56%) of the injuries were treated in EDs, unlike most types of injuries.  Most (58%) of thepatients were under 35 years of age, and residents aged 15 to 19 years had the highest rates of hospital-izations and especially ED visits.  The gender distribution of patients was similar for both settings, withfemales comprising 57% of the total.
Residents of Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal self-inflicted 
injuries compared to residents of Honolulu and Maui counties.  Over half (58%) of the ED visits andmost (85%) of the hospitalizations were caused by poisonings from drugs or medicinal substances,most commonly from the “ analgesics, antipyretics, and antirheumatics” class (22% of ED visits, 33% of hospitalizations), which includes both narcotics (heroin, and other opiates), as well as aspirin and acetaminophen.

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has worked in
traffic safety for more than twenty years.  Since 2005, IPCS has strengthened relationships with state,county and community 
traffic safety partners through its commitment to the development, implementation
and evaluation of the Department of Transportation’s Hawai‘i Strategic Highway Safety Plan .  
/UIforwardIPCS supported and evaluated the Graduated Driver’s Licensing (GDL) legislation that was 
enacted in 2006. In 2010, data from the evaluation led to removal of the sunset clause, making GDL permanent in Hawai‘i .  
/UIforwardWith support and testimony provided by IPCS and traffic safety partners, Hawai‘i  passed an ignitioninterlock law in 2008 that took effect January 2010. The use of ignition interlocks, an evidence-based strategy to prevent alcohol-impaired driving, has been proven to reduce re-arrest rates.  
/UIforwardIn partnership with the Department of Transportation (DOT), IPCS annually supports the nationwide “Click It or Ticket” Campaign – an enhanced enforcement program shown to increasesafety belt use. 
/UIforwardIPCS assists with quality assurance of the traffic safety data collected in real time from EmergencyMedical Services (EMS) personnel across the state in the Hawai‘i  Emergency Medical Services Information System (HEMSIS). HEMSIS is an integral part of the statewide trauma system that theDepartment of Health EMS Branch established. 
/UIforwardWith the support of the DOT, the Keiki Injury Prevention Coalition (KIPC) has established regularsafety check up sites and a network of trained technicians, including child passenger services forchildren with special health needs.
/UIforwardIPCS provides data and technical support to numerous traffic safety partners across the state. 
Recommendations
The following recommendations were prioritized based on results from a statewide survey of 45 state,
county and community traffic safety partners.  This survey included a list of evidence-based program and
policy recommendations, many of which are in the Hawai‘i Strategic Highway Safety Plan .
Motorcycle and Moped Safety
Recommendation 1: Increase helmet use among motorcycle and moped riders by supporting a 
universal moped and motorcycle helmet law
Properly worn helmets prevent deaths and brain injuries. In the event of a crash, helmets reduce the risk of death by 42% and the risk of a head injury by 69% (Liu, et al. 2008).  States that have enacteduniversal helmet laws have seen significant reductions in fatality rates, head injuries and overall medical expenses related to motorcycle injuries (NHTSA 2011). 
In 1968, Hawai‘i enacted a universal helmet law under a federal mandate; it was repealed in 1977. 
Between 1968-1976, motorcycle fatalities in Hawai‘i decreased by 57% (6 per 10,000 registered motorcycles bet ween 19 68-1976 vs. 14 per 10,000 reg istered motorcycles prior to 1968 and after 
the repeal in 1977; NHTSA, 2012). 37 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety
Hawai‘i currently has a partial helmet statute that requires riders
under the age of 18 to wear a helmet. States with universal helmetlaws have motorcycle rider fatality rates that were 20-40% lowerthan states with partial helmet laws (Ulmer & Preusser, 2003).
In Hawai‘i from 2005-2009, more than two thirds (67%) of 
fatally injured motorcycle riders and almost all (96%) of fatallyinjured moped riders were not wearing a helmet at the time ofthe crash; and nearly half (47%) of motorcycle riders and 86% ofmoped riders were not wearing a helmet in non-fatal crashes(NHTSA 2012). Medical costs of helmeted riders average 67%lower than that of un-helmeted riders (Queen’s Hospital Financial System data, 2005-2007).  Currently Medicaid,Medicare, and Quest pay 22.5% of the medical costs for headinjuries associated with motorcycle or moped crashes (Hawai‘iHealth Information Corporation, 2008).  
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardEstablish a working group comprised of traffic safety 
advocates to work on helmet legislation.  
/UIforwardEnhance awareness among decision makers and the publicabout the benefits of motorcycle and moped helmet laws.
Develop and disseminate messages to key decision 
makers and the public that emphasize the effects of helmet laws on health care costs. 
Partner with trauma centers to publicize how helmets 
can prevent traumatic brain injuries and reduce healthcare costs.  
/UIforwardContinue to provide data to traffic safety partners to highlightthe effectiveness of helmets and their cost saving benefits.
Impaired Driving
Recommendation 1: Reduce impaired driving by increasing
the use of screening and brief interventions in hospitals and
primary health centers across the state
Driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs is commonin fatal crashes nationally, and especially in Hawai‘i.  Comparedto other states, Hawai‘i has a higher proportion of fatal crashesthat involve impaired driving (NHTSA, 2012). 
Impairment from alcohol or drugs is represented in all types of
traffic related injuries as well as non-traffic related injuries. It isimportant to address penalties and sanctions to deter impairedPARTNERS

driving and also create opportunities within the medical system to direct high-risk substance users to
methods of reducing substance misuse or treatment.  Con sistent and swift penalties serve as a deterrent,
and access to t reatment helps reduce future incidents.
Research has shown that screening and brief interventions can reduce recidivism of alcohol-related
trauma by up to 50%, which can help reduce DUI arrests and health care costs (Dill, et al., 2004).Screening and brief interventions are practices that help to identify a real or potential alcohol problemand motivate an individual to do something about it.  According to NHTSA’s 2011 report, 
Counter-
measures that Work: A Highway Safety Countermeasure Guide for State Highway Safety Offices , 
the use of screening and brief interventions is a best practice strategy for reducing and preventing impaired driving.  
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardUse data about impaired driving injuries and fatalities to raise awareness about the problem among
key decision makers.
/UIforwardRaise awareness among key decision makers about the effectiveness of screening and brief interventions to prevent impaired driving. 
/UIforwardProvide technical assistance to hospitals and primary health centers interested in implementing ascreening and brief intervention program.
Occupant Protection
Recommendation 1: Increase restraint use by supporting a universal safety belt law for all 
vehicle passengers
The safety belt law in Hawai‘i  does not require a seat belt to be worn by passengers over the age of 17 whoare riding in the back seat. A comprehensive safety belt law would cover all seating positions equippedwith a seat belt, in all passenger vehicles.  Between 2006-2009, nearly 75% of unrestrained passengersinvolved in fatal crashes were unbelted in the back seat of a motor vehicle (NHTSA, 2012).
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardRaise public awareness about injuries and fatalities among unbelted passengers in the back 
seats of vehicles.
/UIforwardEducate key decision makers about the benefits of a universal safety belt law.
/UIforwardContinue to provide data and technical assistance to traffic safety partners about seat belt usage. 39 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety
Recommendation 2: Increase promotion of “high visibility enforcement efforts” for all traffic 
safety laws  
Effective, high-visibility communications and outreach are essential components of successful safety beltlaw enforcement programs (Solomon, et al., 2003).  According to NHTSA, strong advertising around the“Click It or Ticket” campaign has been shown to increase safety belt use by 8.6% (Solomon, et al., 2002). 
IPCS maintains a database of traffic safety partners, including programs within the Department of
Health, county fire departments, county police departments, and local hospitals. During the annual“Click It or Ticket” campaign, IPCS disseminates materials provided by the Hawai‘i Department ofTransportation to partners who have expressed an interest and willingness to participate.  The same dissemination methods could be used to promote other national traffic campaigns aimed at reducing impaired or distracted driving. 
Recommended Next Steps 
/UIforwardMaintain and continuously update IPCS’s partnership database.
/UIforwardSeek new partners to help promote national traffic safety campaigns.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
Recommendation 1: Decrease pedestrian and bicycle-related injuries and fatalities by supporting
“complete streets” policies in each county
“Instituting a complete streets policy ensures that transportation planners and engineers consistently 
design and operate the entire roadway with all users in mind - including bicyclists, public transportation
vehicles and riders, and pedestrians of all ages and abilities.”  (National Complete Streets Coalition)
Since 2005, there has been an increased effort among traffic safety partners and advocates to reduce 
bicycle-related injuries and fatalities.  In conjunction with engineering improvements, improved
planning and design policies, targeted enforcement and public education efforts, and reductions in theaverage number of vehicle miles traveled, bicycle-related deaths in 2009 were nearly half of what theywere in 2005 (NHTSA, 2012). 
In 2009, the Hawai‘i State Legislature passed Act 54 to support complete streets.  Act 54 requires the 
Department of Transportation and county transportation departments to adopt a complete streets policywhen planning future transportation projects.   
Currently, Hawai‘i still has the highest pedestrian fatality rate in the nation for older adults, and 
16 out of 17 bicycle fatalities over the past 5 years involved a motor vehicle. Implementing completestreets design policies and Safe  Routes to School programs will encourage infrastructural, behavioral,
and educational changes to improve the safety and transportation equity for all road users.  40 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety

Injury Data for Motor vehicle crashes, occupants (excluding motorcyclists)
Fatal injuries
This category was the 4th leading cause of fatal injuries to Hawai‘i residents, averaging 58 deaths per
year.  About one-third (32%) of the victims were 15 to 24 years of age.  Most (73%) of the victims weremales.  Fatality rates were si gnificantly higher among Neighbor Island residents, compared to O‘ ahu
residents.  The rates for residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties were particularly high, more than 4times higher than that computed for Honolulu County.  
More than half (57%) of the fatal crashes occurred during nighttime hours (7:29 p.m. to 5:31 a.m.), and
61% involved only a single vehicle.  Lack of restraint use was a major risk factor for occupant fatalities,as less than half of the victims (47%) were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.  Restraint use wasespecially low among back seat pass engers (25%).  Speeding was the m ost common contributing factor,
noted for 41% of the drivers.  Substance use was also an important contributing factor, as 40% of thedrivers involved in fatal car crashes tested positive for alcohol, almost one-quarter (23%) tested positive for drugs, and nearly half (49%) tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  The peak age of alcohol use among drivers was 21 to 24 years of age, as 56% tested positive for alcohol.  More thanhalf (56%) of the fatalities from car crashes were related to alcohol consumption by at least one driver involved in the crash.Trend: decreasing

Nonfatal injuries
There were more than 4000 nonfatal injuries among car occupants each year in Hawai‘i, with a 
decreasing annual trend.  Most (91%) of the injuries were treated in EDs (emergency departments).Patient age was widely distributed, although 27% were 15 to 24 years of age, and this age group alsohad by far the highest rate of injury.  There were nearly equal numbers of female (52%) and male(48%) patients.  
The nonfatal injury rate for residents of Hawai‘i County was significantly higher than the rate for
residents of any other county, while the rate for Honolulu County residents was significantly lowerthan that for residents of any other county.  Almost all (95%) of the injuries were coded as “traffic”, or occurring on public roads.  Patients were hospitalized for an average of nearly 1 week, with nearly$46,000 in average medical charges per patient.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
Most (86%) of the injured occupants treated by EMS were wearing seatbelts.  Restraint use wasstrongly associated with EMS patient disposition, including a 7-fold increase in mortality rateamong unrestrained occupants (4.5%) compared to those who wore seatbelts (0.6%).  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 10% of the patients, and drinkers were significantly less likely to use seatbelts (71%, vs. 88% for other occupants).  Linked data from 2007 showed unrestrained EMS patients had more than twice (2.3) the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, compared to restrained occupants, and more than triple (3.2) the odds of a fatal injury.  These excess risks were statistically independent of patient age, gender, or the county of the crash.
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
About one-third of the injured resident occupants in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry tested positive for 
alcohol (32%) or illicit drugs (35%).  Considered together, more than half (52%, or 626) of the occupantstested positive for either al cohol or drugs.  Occupants who were drinking were significantly younger
than those who tested negative for al cohol (32 vs. 41 years, on average), more likely to be male (75% vs.
56%), and less likely to have used seat belts (46% vs. 63%).  Trend: decreasing

Injury Data for Motor vehicle crashes, motorcyclists
Fatal injuries
Deaths among motorcyclists were the 6th leading cause of fatal unintentional injuries in the state, 
accounting for 146 total deaths from 2007 to 2011 .  Nearly half (45%) of the victims were adult males
20 to 40 years of age.  Most (73%) of the decedents were riding motorcycles; there were also 27 mopedriders who were killed, including 16 over the 2010 to 2011 period.  The 5-year fatality rates were significantly higher for residents of Hawai‘i and Maui counties compared to Honolulu County. 
Almost half (46%) of the fatal crashes did not involve another vehicle, although that proportion was
lower (26%) among the fatally injured moped riders.  Only about one-fourth (27%) of all riders werewearing a helmet at the time of the crash, including only 7% of the moped riders.  Nearly half (47%) of the decedents tested positive for alcohol, and 29% for illicit drugs.  Alcohol use was most commonamong drivers who crashed during nighttime (66%) and among those in crashes without another motorvehicle (69%).  About half (51%) of the fatally injured drivers did not have a valid motorcyclist license,and that proportion was significantly higher among those who had consumed alcohol (58%, vs. 44%among other drivers).  More than one-half (58%) of the riders were noted to have been speeding atthe time of the crash, a proportion that was higher among motorcyclists (62%) and those who crashedon O‘ ahu (66%).

Nonfatal injuries
There was a decreasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among motorcyclists over the
2007 to 2010 period, but an increase in 2011 .  More than 1000 were treated in EDs each year and another 276 were hospitalized.  Patient age was narrowly distributed, with 51% between 15 and 34 yearsof age.  The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was among 20 to 24 year olds.Most (83%) of the patients were males.  
Although about half (54%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County, residents there had 
significantly lower rates of nonfatal injuries than residents of any other county.  Injury rates were 
approximately twice as high among residents of Neighbor Islands.  Forty-four percent of the crashes did not involve a collision, but were due to loss of control by the rider.  Three-fourths (75%) of the nonfatal injuries were coded as “traffic” related, or  occurring on a public roadway, while 25% were in
“non-traffic” environments, including off-road crashe s.  Nearly one-fifth (19%)  of the patients who 
were injured in non-traffic crashes were 5 to 14 years of age.  The average hospitalization was nearly 
1 week in duration and resulted in over $51 ,000 in medical charges.  About two-thirds (64%) of thehospitalized patients and one-quarter (23%) of those treated in EDs had fractures.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
About 55% of the EMS Patients were riding motorcycles (55%), and 40% were riding mopeds (status unknown for 5%). 
About two-thirds (65%) of all riders were wearing a helmet.  The proportion not 
wearing helmets was significantly higher, nearly doubled, among the moped riders (68%), compared to motorcycle riders (38%).  Patient condition differed by helmet usage, as helmeted riders were significantly more likely to be transported with minor or moderate injuries (23%, co mpared to 19% for
unhlemeted riders), and significantly less likely to be transported in critical condition (1 .9% vs. 3.7%).The mortality rate among helmeted riders (2.5%, or 31 of 1249) was also significantly less than thatamong unhelmeted riders (4.6%, or 86 of 1879).  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 12% of the patients, and alcohol users were significantly less likely to have worn helmets (14%, vs 41% amongthose with no alcohol use).
Linked data from 2007 showed the odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or 
resulted in death were 40% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, and the former also had more than twice the odds (2.2) of a fatal injury.  The protective effects of helmet usewere magnified if only motorcycle ri ders were considered.  Unhelmeted m otorcycle riders had twice 
the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, more than 3 times the odds of a fatal injury, and 3 times the odds of a TBI (traumatic brain injury).Trend: no trend

Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
About one-fourth (26%) of the injured resident motorcycle/moped riders in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry
tested positive for alcohol, including 21% (178) with BAC (blood alcohol content) levels of 0.08 or greater,and 14% (117) with BAC levels of 0. 16% or greater.  Moped riders were significantly more likely thanmotorcyclists to have been drinking (31% vs 24%, respectively).  More than half (54%, or 464) of the riders tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, including most (78%) of the 285 moped riders.  Alcoholusage was 4 times more common among those who crashed during night time (54%) compared to thosewho crashed between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (14%).
Motor vehicle crashes, pedestrians
Fatal injuries
There was no statistically significant trend in the annual number of pedestrian fatalities, although the highest total occurred in 2007 (37 deaths).  Senior-aged residents comprised 47% of the victims, and the fatality rates increased dramatically across the oldest age groups.  Most (69%) of the victims were hit on O‘ ahu, but there were no significant differences in county-specific fatality rates.  Almost all (80%) of the victims who were 65 years or older were hit on O‘ ahu, and the fatality rate for O‘ ahu seniors was statistically comparable to that for seniors living on Neighbor Islands (36 vs. 22 deaths/100,000, respectively).    
There were 2 peak times for pedestrian fatalities: 27 crashes (21% of the total) occurred between 5:31 a.m.
and 9:29 a.m., and 40 (31%) took place between 5:31 p.m. and 11:29 p.m.  Only 34% of the victims were ina crosswalk at the time of the crash; a nearly equal proportion (35%) were hit on open stretches of roadway.The most common speed zone was 25 miles per hour (45% of crashes).  Almost two-thirds than half(63%) of the senior-aged victims were hit in 25 mph or slower zones, compared to 33% of pedestriansunder the age of 65 years.  According to FARS data from 2007 to 2010, more than one-quarter (26%) of the 84 fatally injured pedestrians tested positive for alcohol, and 25% had BAC levels of 0.08% orhigher. Alcohol use was significantly higher amo ng male victims (42%) compared to females (6%).  The
highest prevalence of alcohol use was seen among victims in the 21 to 34 year age group (70%, or 7 of 10),and the 35 to 54 year age group (52%, or 11 of 21).  According to FARS data, 39% (33) of the pedestrianvictims were in the roadway erroneously, most commonly by “improper crossing of roadway or intersection”, including jaywalking (21%, or 18 victims).  Including the victims who tested positive for alcohol or drugs, 54% (or 45) of the pedestrians made an error that contributed to the crash.  More
than half (59%, or 52) of the 88 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash.  Most commonly,they were described as “inattentive” (38%), failed to yield the right of way (25%), or were speeding (18%).  Trend: no trend

Nonfatal injuries
The annual number of nonfatal injuries to pedestrians generally decreased from 649 in 2007 to 583 in
2011 .  About one-quarter (23%) of the patients with nonfatal injuries were admitted to hospitals, thehighest such proportion for any unintentional injury category.  Patient age was widely distributed, butone-third (33%) were in the 5 to 24 year age group.  This group also had the highest rate of nonfatal injuries that were treated in E Ds, while senior aged residents had the highest rates of hospitalizations.
The rates of both ED visits and all injuries (ED visits combined with hospitalizations) were lowest for
Maui County residents, although all county-specific rates were statistically comparable.  Most (88%) ofthe nonfatal injuries were coded as  “traffic” related, or occurring on a public roadway, while 12% were in
“non-traffic” environments, including private roads, driveways and parking lots.  Thirty percent ofthe patients injured in non-traffic crashes were in the 1 to 14 year age group.  Patients were hospitalizedfor an average of 9 days, with nearly $60,000 in medic al charges.  Hospitalization s accounted for most
(73%) of total patient days and 87% of the $9.4 million in total medical charges.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
There were 2 peak periods for the time of the EMS-attended crashes, from 6:31 a.m. to 8:29 a.m. (13%,or 287 crashes), and from 2:29 p.m. to 7:29 p.m. (35%, or 788 crashes).  The time distribution differedby patient age, as crashes with senior-aged pedestrians were more likely to occur during daytime hours(86%), compared to crashes involving pedestrians under 65 years of age (73%).  Patient condition differedby age, as senior-aged pedestrians were significantly more likely to be transported to a hospital, comparedto pedestrians under 65 years of age (85% vs. 79%, respectively), and had a significantly higher mortality
rate (10.3%, or 47 of 456, vs. 3.6%, or 67 of 1855).  The mortality rate was also significantly elevatedamong pedestrians who were hit during night time hours (7.4%, or 42 of 566), compared to those hitbetween 5:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (4. 1%, or 72 of 1747), despite the younger age d istribution among the
former.  Probable al cohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.  Patients who had used alcohol
had generally worse dispositions, and were more than three times as likely to require transport incritical cond ition, and nearly twice as likely to have died, compared to those who did not use alcohol.    Trend: decreasing

Injury Data for Motor Vehicle Crashes, Bicyclists
Fatal injuries
There were between 2 and 4 bicyclists killed in Hawai‘i each year, and 80% (12) of the 15 deaths occurredon O‘ ahu.  There was no apparent high-risk age group.  Almost all (87%, or 13) of the bicyclists killedover the 5-year period were males.  Most (87%, or 13) of the victims were hit by a car; 2 others died afterfalling off their bicycles.  Only 2 of the victims were wearing helmets at the time of the crash (statusunknown for 2 others).  There was no notable peak time of the day for the crashes; most (64%, or 9)occurred between during daylight hours between 7:31 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  
Almost all (91%, or 10) of the 11 traffic-related crashes (from 2007 to 2010) involved cars traveling
straight on the road; only 1 crash was due to a car making a turn.  Two (18%) of the 11 bicyclists testedpositive for alcohol, and 4 (36%) tested positive for drugs.  Overall, about half (54%, or 6) of the victimstested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Besides substance use 2 bicyclists were traveling against  traffic at the time of the crash and another failed to yield the right-of -way.  Four (36%) of the 11 drivers
made an error which contributed to the crash, most commonly substance use and speeding (2 instances each).  
Nonfatal injuries
There were more than 1200 nonfatal injuries to bicyclists each year, with a generally increasing trend.
Most (92%) of the injuries were treated in EDs (emergency departments).  Males comprised 75% of thepatients, including 80% of those who were hospitalized.  Nearly one-third (31%) of the patients were 5 to14 years of age, and the injury rate for 5 to 14 year-olds (244 injuries/100,000 residents) were more than3 times higher than the rate for residents of other ages (74/100,000).

The injury rate for Kaua‘i County residents was significantly higher than the rates for any other county,
and approximately double the rate estimates for residents of Honolulu or Maui counties.  Almost all(85%) of the injuries were coded as “non-traffic”, or occurring on private roads, driveways, or off-roadenvironments.  Most of the injuri es treated in EDs (88%) and re quiring hospitalization (71%) were coded to
indicate crashes that did not involve a collision w ith another vehicle or object, but were probably due to
the patient falling off of the bicycle.  Although 92% of the patients were treated in EDs, hospitalizationscomprised 32% of the treatment days and 66% of the total medical charges of $5.8 million/year.  Most(63%) of the hospitalized patients had fractures, including 15% with skull fra ctures and 20% with leg
fractures.  More than one-third (38%) of these patients had a traumatic brain injury.
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
Most (73%) of the EMS-attended bicyclist crashes were distributed over the 11-hour period of 7:31 a.m. to6:29 p.m., with a peak from 4:31 p.m. to 6:29 p.m. (17%).  About half (53%) of the injuries involved motorvehicles and 47% did not.  Only 27% of the injured bicyclists wore helmets.  Unhelmeted riders had asignificantly higher proportion of “ critical” or fatal injuries (2. 1%, or 22 of 1031), compared to helmetedriders (0.7%, or 3 of 458).  These differences were acc entuated among crashes that involved motor vehicles,
as the proportion of unhelmeted bicyclists with critical or fatal injuries was 3. 1% (17 of 540), compared to0.9% (2 of 214) among helmeted riders.  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.If only the bicyclists with known alcohol and helmet status were considered, helmet use was 5 timeshigher among those who did not consume alcohol (35%), compared to the drinkers (5%).  
Linked data from 2007 showed odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death were 80% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, although this estimatewas only of “borderline” statistical significance (p=0. 11).  
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Only 11% of the injured bicyclists in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry had been drinking at the time they
were injured.  T his percentage was nearly three times higher among those hurt in crashes that did not
involve a motor vehicle compared to those who were hit by motor vehicles (15% vs. 6%, respectively).About one-quarter of the bicyclists tested positive for illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (17%),and this proportion did not differ by the type of crash.  Overall, one-third (33%, or 89) of the 271 patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  None of the 28 bicyclists who had been drinking werewearing a helmet at the time of the crash, compared to 27% usage among those who tested negative for alcohol, and 31% among those who were not tested.

The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Maternal and Child Health Branch (MCHB) leads activities 
in the state to prevent intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and child maltreatment, with supportfrom the Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) and other partners in the community.  IPCS hasbeen specifically involved with bullying prevention and also leads activities in the state to prevent suicide prevention.
/UIforwardBeginning in 2009, IPCS and community partners worked with MCHB to identify Title V bullying
prevention and child abuse and neglect prevention performance measures.  With technical support from the national Children’s Safety Network, MCHB and IPCS collaborated to conduct the first statewide cross-program int egration training in November 2009 for bullying and child
abuse and neglect prevention. The training strengthened collaborative efforts between IPCS, MCHB,and community partners on program and policy initiatives related to violence prevention.
/UIforwardThe Safe Schools Community Advisory Committee developed 33 recommendations for policies andstrategies to address bullying and harassment in public schools.  Members are currently working toget these recommendations adopted by the Board of Education and Department of Education.
/UIforwardThe Maui County Ho‘ oikaika Partnership is a group of agencies working together since 2008 toimplement best practices and policies as they strengthen violence prevention services for childrenand their caregivers. This collaborative initiative serveS as a model for similar partnerships acrossthe state.
/UIforwardThe Asian/Pacific Islander Youth Violence Prevention Center was established in 2000 as one of tenNational Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention funded by CDC.  Sincethen, the Center has partnered with IPCS and other organizations to conduct research on youth 
violence and develop, implement and evaluate violence prevention programs.
/UIforwardIPCS helped establish a non-profit coalition to promote primary prevention of violence, Prevent Violence H awai‘i.  IPCS funded the University of Hawai‘i Social Science Research Institute 
to produce, Ending Violence: A 2004 Status Report on Violence Prevention in Hawai‘i.  The report’s
recommendations were based on the World Health Organization’s approach to addressing riskfactors and solutions common to all areas of violence.  Concerns about sustaining efforts in individualareas of violence hampered the organization’s ability to take a unified approach to violence prevention, and the non-profit dissolved in 2010.
Recommendations
In 2010, a statewide needs assessment was conducted that included an online survey of 149 people 
representing government agencies, law enforcement, schools and universities, medical centers, non-profit organizations, private businesses, and grassroots organizations; and qualitative interviews with 21 key informants from state agencies and universities.  A cross-disciplinary stakeholder group was convened to review the results and recommendations, and assess whether they reflected the potential for measurable progress and impact over the next five years. 
The resulting recommendations outlined here build on Ending Violence: A 2004 Status Report on 
Violence Prevention in Hawai‘i and the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010.  They reflectstakeholders’ renewed readiness to collaborate. Effectively preventing violence will take the concerted efforts of individuals and organizations from all sectors working together across all areas of violence.49 Injury Specific RecommendationsViolence and Abuse Prevention
Recommendation 1: Establish and promote forums for collaboration and information sharing to help
integrate violence and abuse prevention efforts statewide 
While different types of violence share common risk factors and prevention strategies, prevention efforts are often independent. Forums that encourage organizations that serve different populations and address different types of violence to share information about effective strategies would facilitatecollaboration and coordination of efforts (Saul, et al, 2008). 
Efforts should be comprehensive and address the different types of violence, encourage the use of 
evidence-based program and policy practices, and account for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention as appropriate.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardFacilitate opportunities for inter-agency collaboration and coordination among organizations 
serving different populations and addressing various sub-forms of violence.
/UIforwardExpand the use of new and existing channels of communication such as newsletters, listservs, websites, clearinghouses, and other means of technology to facilitate the exchange of informationand resources among partners at all levels and in all areas of violence.
Recommendation 2: Collaborate with professionals and community workers to develop a public
awareness campaign about violence and abuse prevention.
Current partners represent all levels of prevention and include community and non-profit socialservice organizations, primary health care centers, law enforcement, and selected policymakers. But there are additional partners who may not be aware of their potential role in violence prevention or understand the value of their programs to violence prevention efforts.
Engaging partners in the development, implementation and evaluation of a communications campaign
to raise public awareness will increase likelihood of success at all levels (e.g., developing messages, producing materials, identifying appropriate channels for dissemination).

Recommendation 3: Promote training that enhances knowledge and skills of community workers
and professionals working in violence prevention and related fields
There should be continued training among providers and organizations, and audiences should extendbeyond those working directly in the violence and abuse prevention fields.  For example, teachers andcounselors could receive related information as part of their academic training.  Organizations couldadopt violence prevention modules as part of their new employee orientation protocols.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardIdentify training opportunities and resources available to community workers in the violence and
abuse prevention fields to enhance their knowledge and skills in primary prevention.
/UIforwardIdentify training opportunities and resources for other professionals and community members toenhance their knowledge and skills in primary prevention.
Recommendation 4: Enhance the use of data to understand common risk and protective factors 
for violence prevention
Data are crucial to understanding the complex issue of violence.  Data help programs develop priorities,guide interventions and policies, and mobilize support (World Health Organization, 2002).  Barriers tocollecting and sharing information across agencies need to be removed so that data are accessible toeveryone.  There also are additional data sources (i.e., on different types of violence) that would help illustrate trends and better guide research and intervention efforts.  
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardFacilitate data and information sharing across state agencies.
/UIforwardIdentify and acquire new data sources to develop an annual report on child maltreatment that will
enhance understanding of violence and abuse.51 Injury Specific RecommendationsViolence and Abuse Prevention
Injury Data for Homicides and Assaults
Fatal injuries
There were 112 victims of homicide over the 5-year period, with a decreasing trend from 29 in 2008 to 
17 in 2011 .   More than half (58%) of the victims were in the 25 to 54 year age range, but there were also 6 victims (5%) who were u nder 5 years of age.  Males comprised 59% of the victims.  The fatality rate
for residents of O‘ ahu (8.8 deaths/100, 000 residents) was statistically comparable to the rate for all
Neighbor Island residents (8.4/100,000).  
The most common method was the use of firearms (35%), followed by stabbings (28%), and physical
force or unarmed beatings (25%).  According to Uniform Crime Reports from 2007 to 2009, most (73%)of the homicide victims knew their assailant, and only a minority (19%) were killed by strangers.  Femalevictims were most likely to be killed by their intimate partner (37%, vs. 5% of male victims), while maleswere most likely to be killed by extra-familial acquaintances (40%) or strangers (25%).
Nonfatal injuries
There were over 4200 nonfatal injuries from assaults among Hawai‘i residents each year, with noclear trend over time.  Males comprised two-thirds (67%) of the patients treated in EDs (emergencydepartments) and an even greater proportion (89%) of those who were hospitalized.  More than half(58%) of the patients were 15 to 34 years of age; few (5%) were under 15 years of age, or over 65 yearsof age (1%).  The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was the 15 to 29 year agegroup, particularly 20 to 24 year-olds.  Trend: decreasing trend

the rate for residents of Honolulu County was significantly lower than any other county.  Patients werehospitalized for nearly 5 days on average, with over $31 ,000 in charges for each admission.  Unarmedbeatings caused 70% of all injuries, and 61% of those that required hospitalization.  Fractures were themost common type of injury (53%) that required hospitalization, including 44% of patients admittedwith a skull fracture.
EMS data
The number of EMS-attended incidents generally increased over the course of the day (starting at 6 a.m.),reaching a broad peak during the 7:31 p.m. to 2:29 a.m. period (48% of the total).  The home or residenceof the patient was the most common location for the assault (40%), followed by other indoor location orbuildings (17%), most commonly “public buildings” (7%), and bars and restaurants (6%).  One-fifth (20%)of the patients were transported in serious or critical condition.  That proportion was highest among thesenior-aged victims (29%).  Probable alcohol use was noted for 29% of the patients.  Patients who had consumed alcohol were significantly less likely to be released at the scene (34%, vs. 52% for other patients),and twice as likely to be transported in serious condition (31% vs. 15%, respectively).    
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Nearly half (46%) of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry resident patients
who were i njured by assaults were p ositive for alcohol, and more than one-third (38%) tested positive for
illicit drugs.  About three-fourths (76%, or 286) of the 375 drinkers had BAC (blood alcohol content)levels of 0.08% or greater.  THC (marijuana) was the most commonly documented drug (19% of thepatients), followed by amphetamines (15%) and narcotics (15%).  Considered together, about two-thirds(67%) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol use was significantly morelikely among the male patients (49%) compared to females (27%), among those injured on weekends(54% vs. 41% for those assaulted on weekdays), and among those assaulted during night time hours(54%, vs. 30% for those injured between 6:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m.).Violence and Abuse Prevention53 AppendicesRECOMMENDATIONS STATUS* CURRENT COMMENTS

among residents of Hawai‘i.  This is consistent with national reporting conventions of injury mortalityand allows for the comparison of fat al injury rates in Hawai‘i with rates for the remainder of the country.
Also, other population estimates (e.g. age, ethnicity, county, etc.) were available only for residents, sothe inclusion of injuries among non-residents would result in an over-estimation of injury rates.  Theexclusion of non-residents reduces the amount of fatal injuries by about 9%, hospitalizations by 9%, andemergency department visits by 9%.  (Non-residents compr ised 47% of the drowning victims in Hawai‘i,
so they are included in some of the data in the drowning section.)
The calculation of injury mortality rates necessitates the definition of “ at risk” populations for 
the denominator.  This data was obtained from the web site for the U.S. Census Bureau (2012).  Rate estimates used the average annual population estimate over the 2007 to 2010, since 2011 estimates were not available when preparation of this report began.  
The primary source of injury mortality data in Hawai‘i is the death certificate database of the Hawai‘i
Department of Health.  The ICD-10 underlying cause of death codes were grouped as recommended bythe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with some exceptions (CDC, 2002).  For some types ofinjuries, the open text information on how the injury occurred was reviewed to extract information notcaptured by the cause of death code.  Supplemental data was also used for certain injury categories.Data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was linked to death certificate data for deaths from traffic crashes(NHTSA, n.d.).  Supplemental data on homicides was abstracted from the Uniform Crime Reports(UCR), maintained by the National Archive of Criminal Justice data (2010).  The autopsy records of O‘ ahu suicide and drowning victims were also reviewed for the 2007 to 2010 period.  
The main source of data on nonfatal injuries was the Hawai‘i Health Information Corporation (HHIC),
which receives abstracted data from the medical records of patients treated in all hospital-basedemergency departments (EDs) and hospitals in the state, with the exception of  ED records from TriplerArmy Medical Center.  A record was defined as injury-related if the principle diagnosis was within theICD-9CM series 800-995.85, with the following exclusions: 909.3, 909.5, 995.0-995.4, 995.6-995.7(Injury Surveillance Workgroup, 2003).  Patients who died in the hospitals or who were discharged tohospice facilities were excluded from these analyses.  To prevent double-counting of injuries, patientswho were transferred to another hospital at discharge were excluded.  Injuries resulting from “ adverse effects”, as indicated by external cause of injury codes (E-codes) were also excluded (CDC, 2007).
E-codes were used to group nonfatal injuries into mechanisms that corresponded to the groupings for
fatal injuries (CDC, 2007).  In this report, all nonfatal self-inflicted injuries are described as “suicide attempts”, although this is not actually discernible through E-codes.  This may have resulted in an overestimation of suicide attempts, but it is also possible that self-inflicted injuries in generalare underreported.  
It is important to note that the extent of E-coding varied across the counties patients reside in, and over
time within those counties.  The records for residents of Neighbor Islands were significantly more likelyto have E-codes than records for residents of Honolulu County (on average 97.4% vs. 87.5%, respectively).There were also decreasing trends in the proportion of inpatient records with E-codes for all countiesexcept Maui, although these were most meaningful for O‘ ahu hospitals.  These variations in E-coding needto be considered when interpreting comparisons between counties and examining trends within a countyAppendix B: Data Sources and Methods59 Appendicesover time.  Most statistics in this report are based only on E-coded records, and therefore underestimate
the real magnitude of injuries by about 9% for both those treated at EDs and for those injuries requiringhospitalizations.  There was some inconsistency in the contribution to the HHIC database from certainindividual hospitals.  One O‘ ahu hospital began contributing ED records in November, 2008, althoughthis hospital accounted for only 1 .4% of ED records.  Two other O‘ ahu hospitals closed operations in mid-December of 2011 .  
EMS data is included in certain chapters (motor vehicle crashes, falls and assaults) for which there were
discreet injury codes in the EMS data collection system.  EMS personnel document the use of protectiveequipment (seat belts and helmets) and the approximate time and location of the injury, elements whichare lacking from the more population-based HHIC data.  Patient use of alcohol and drugs is also noted in EMS data, either by patient admission, the smell of alcohol on the breath, or physical evidence (e.g.bottles, drug paraphernalia, etc.) at the scene.  However, since use of “ drugs” is not specific, only the EMScharacterization of patient alcohol use is examined.  To avoid double-counting of individual patients,those who were transferred to another EMS unit were excluded from analyses.  Patients who refusedtransport to hospitals (or released at the scene) and those who were dead upon EMS arrival or who diedwhile in EMS care were included, however, to provide a full description of the effects of protective factorsor alcohol use.  
A grant from the Hawai‘i Department of Transportation (DOT) enabled the linkage of 2007 EMS records
related to motor vehicle crashes to DOT, HHIC, and FARS, and death certificate records.  EMS recordswere linked to DOT, FARS and death certificate records probabilistically, on the basis of time, date, andlocation of the crash, and patient age, gender and seating position.  This product was then linked toHHIC records by deterministic methods using patient identifiers, including name and date of birth.This linked dataset provided examination of the effect of protective devices (as described by EMS, DOTand FARS) with the ultimate medical disposition of the patients (as described by HHIC records anddeath certificates).  
More complete and test-based results of toxicology were available from the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (HTR).
The HTR includes data from the 7 main trauma centers in the state.  Data was available for the 2008 to2011 period, but 6 of the trauma centers did not begin contributing data until 2009.  HTR data was included to provide a description of substance use among patients who had nonfatal (although serious)injuries from a variety of mechanisms.  To avoid double-counting, the results of HTR patients who weretransferred at discharge were excluded.  Patients who died, either in the ED or after hospitalization, were included, to examine associations between substance use and mortality for injuries where these relationships are not better described through other data systems (e.g. motor vehicle deaths and FARS).  
Most of the injury rates have been standardized for age distribution, by the direct method, using the 
U.S. 2000 standard population (Anderson & Rosenberg, 1998).  Sixteen age groups were used for standardization across all ages, although certain calculations were restricted to more narrow age ranges.Statistical tests were conducted with t-tests for continuously distributed variables (e.g. patient age) andchi-squared tests for categorical variables (e.g. patient gender).  Some trends (described as “significant”or “non-significant”) were formally assessed using Poisson regression (Clayton & Hills, 1993).  Rate differences were tested using different techniques, depending on sample size and use of age standardiza-tion (Dever, 1984).  All statistical significance testing was conducted at the 95% confidence level.  Appendix B: Data Sources and Methods60 AppendicesADRC – Adult Disability Resources Centers

The Spectrum of Prevention is a broad framework that outlines seven levels of intervention, or strategies,
intended to address complex public health problems.  These strategies account for the various factorsthat contribute to community health and safety and can be used to develop a comprehensive approachto address public health concerns. 
Influencing Policy and Legislation
Legislation and policy initiatives affect large numbers of people by improving their environments, encouraging healthy lifestyles, and providing for consumer protections.
Mobilizing Neighborhoods and Communities
Engaging neighborhoods and communities in the process of identifying, prioritizing and addressingpublic health concerns leads to more accepted and successful community interventions. 
Changing Organizational Practices
Modifying internal policies and practices of agencies and organizations can lead to improved healthand safety for staff and clients and contribute to a healthier community.  Changing practices in someagencies (e.g., law enforcement, schools) may also affect community health.
Fostering Coalitions and Networks
Coalitions and networks that represent local government, public health, private and nonprofitorganizations, health care, and the community provide an opportunity for collaborative planning, coordinated use of resources, and strong support of legislation and organizational change. 
Educating Providers
Educated providers, in and out of the health field, play an important role by identifying injury preventionissues and intervening as needed. Providers may encourage adoption of injury prevention behaviors, offereducation, and advocate for legislation and organizational change. 
Promoting Community Education
Community education uses different communication channels to reach as many people as possible withhealth education messages.  These messages aim to change behaviors and build a critical mass of peoplewho will become engaged in the issue. 
Strengthening Individual Knowledge and Skills
Health educators and trained community members work directly with individuals to promote health andsafety. Attention may be given to building individuals’ capacity to use new approaches, educate others,or become more engaged in advocacy.

Dear Community Colleagues,
We are pleased to present you with the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 that serves as a guide
for reducing the eight leading causes of injury in Hawai‘i. This document builds on the previous Hawai‘i
Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 and is the result of a collaborative effort between the Hawai‘i State
Department of Health (DOH), Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention System Branch (EMSIPSB); the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC); and other community partners.  In thegap period between the end of the previous plan and inception of the new plan, the initial plan continuedto guide the work of the DOH Injury Prevention and Control Section and community partners.
Here in Hawai‘i, we have made great strides in preventing injuries through the cooperative efforts of
government agencies, voluntary and professional organizations, and numerous other communitypartners.  There is much more we must do, however, to further reduce the burden of injury. 
Injury prevention remains an under-recognized and under-funded area of public health.  Now more than
ever, we must leverage our resources to join the best knowledge and practices with strong partnerships toeffectively prevent injuries, thereby reducing pain and suffering, and saving Hawai‘i millions of dollarseach year.  We must work together to raise public awareness, build community capacity for injuryprevention efforts, make changes to the physical environment, and implement policy and organizationalpractices that prevent injuries.
On behalf of the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee and the Hawai‘i State Department of Health,
we invite you to join us in achieving the recommendations set forth in this plan.  Please contact us throughwww.nogethurthawaii.gov or call the Injury Prevention and Control Section on O‘ ahu at (808)733-9320. 
Working together, we can accomplish what none of us can do alone.

causes combined, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Among residents of all ages, injury is thefourth leading cause of death and disability.  The vast majority of injuries, however, are non-fatal andcan lead to a range of outcomes, including temporary pain and inconvenience, disability, chronic pain,or a complete change in lifestyle. 
During an average week in Hawai‘i: 
/UIforward13 residents die from an injury
/UIforward115 are hospitalized
/UIforwardNearly 1 ,530 are treated in emergency departments 
While the greatest impact of injury is in human suffering, the financial cost is staggering. In Hawai‘i, 
injury-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $364 million annually. Injury Prevention is a Public Health Priority in Hawai ‘i

5Most (92%) of these patients were “struck accidentally by objects or persons”; the rest (9%) were “struck accidentally by falli ng object”.  Of the former,
the most commonly specified causes were “striking…in sports” (20%), and “striking against…furniture” (4%).  For the 30% of 2010  and 2011 records
with specific coding, most (79%) of these injuries were sports-related, most commonly “surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding ” (16%), “american tackle
football” (15%), basketball (10%), baseball (9%), and soccer (7%).    
6Most (95%) of these injuries were related to “Overexertion and strenuous movements”, with no further specificity.  Subcategorie s include overexertion
from sudden strenuous movements (39%), and trauma from repetitive motion, loads or impacts (17%).  For the 30% of 2010 and 2011  records with 
specific coding, about half (44%) of these injuries were sports-related, including basketball (14%), and baseball, soccer and v olleyball (5% each).  Another
13% were due to “walking, marching and hiking”, and 6% to running.

support from the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC), completed the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention
Plan (HIPP) with funding from a Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention Program capacity
building grant and a Core Violence and Injury Prevention Program grant, both from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
The 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2012-2017 , is a plan for injury prevention activities during the next
five years. Developed in collaboration with partners from across the state, the plan provides:
/UIforwardOverall direction and focus of IPCS and IPAC-led efforts 
/UIforwardStimulus for organizations, agencies and community groups to collaborate on reducing or preventing injuries in Hawai‘i
This report builds on the earlier, 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 (available online: 
www.nogethurt.hawaii.gov).  Details about the state’s progress toward meeting the objectives outlined in the 2005-2010 report can be found in the Appendix A.
HIPP is a collaborative effort that reflects the current thinking of public health professionals and
community partners in the following areas: 
/UIforwardCore capacity to sustain injury prevention policy and program activities
/UIforwardDrowning 
/UIforwardFalls among older adults
/UIforwardPoisoning
/UIforwardTraffic-related injuries
/UIforwardSuicide
/UIforwardViolence and abuse
IPCS worked closely with experts and stakeholders in each area to review accomplishments, conduct
needs assessments, and develop recommendations for the next five years.  Additional information aboutthe processes used to generate these recommendations are included in the individual chapters.Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan6 IntroductionThe Injury Prevention and Control Section is part of the Emergency Medical Services and Injury
Prevention System Branch at the Hawai‘i State Department of Health. IPCS is the focal point in theDepartment of Health for injury prevention throughout the state for all age groups.
IPCS is responsible for coordinating, planning, conducting, and evaluating injury prevention programs;
developing policy and coordinating advocacy; collecting, analyzing and disseminating injury data; andproviding technical support and training. Much of their work is achieved through community coalitionsand partnerships in order to increas e and focus community resources, minimize duplication of effort,
and support the injury prevention activities of local agencies and community organizations.  The Spectrumof Prevention is used as a guiding model for IPCS’s work to prevent injuries in Hawai‘i (see Appendix E).IPCS also provides staff support to IPAC.

The Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan (HIPP) can be used in a variety of ways by local agencies, 
businesses, community organizations, advocacy groups, planners, decision-makers, researchers, and others interested in preventing injuries. Examples include:
/UIforwardCollaboration
Groups and individuals interested in addressing a particular injury area can use HIPP to assess the current thinking, get an understanding of the key players involved, and build consensus for implementing priority activities. 
/UIforwardPolicy making
Advocacy groups working in injury prevention can use HIPP to support and act on prioritized areasof concern and identify key partners to collaborate with.
/UIforwardProgram planning
Organizations and individuals interested in addressing a particular injury area can use HIPP forpriority setting and action planning. 
/UIforwardResearch
Researchers, including graduate and medical students, can use HIPP to develop studies to adapt and evaluate evidence-based practices for Hawai‘i.How the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan Can Be Used 8 Core CapacityPolicy and Program Activities
Background and Accomplishments
Since the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 was released, the Hawai‘i State Department 
of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has worked closely with partners in the community to build and strengthen the infrastructure to support injury prevention policy, research,surveillance and programs in Hawai‘i. 
/UIforwardWith the support of IPAC, IPCS added a suicide prevention coordinator to their staff and now has three permanent state-funded positions. 
/UIforwardComplete and accurate data are critical to assessing and understanding the injury problem, and also to developing and evaluating prevention programs. E-codes capture how an injury happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or intentional, such as suicide or assault), and the place where the event occurred.  IPCS led efforts to establish new standards for external cause of injury coding (e-coding) for hospitals to achieve and maintain.  Currently, 90% of all emergency department and hospital admission records meet the new standards, up from 51% in 2003.
/UIforwardIn collaboration with Kapiolani Community College, Emergency Services Department, IPCShelped to develop, implement and evaluate injury prevention training modules for the emergencymedical technician (EMT) program and mobile intensive care technician (MICT) program, and a continuing education module for emergency medical services personnel.
/UIforwardAiming to develop a cadre of individuals and organizations who are injury literate, articulate,and active, IPCS conducted public health competency building workshops and worked with affiliated injury prevention groups  to coordinate conferences specific to certain injuries. 
/UIforwardIn 2008, IPCS produced the Injuries in Hawai‘i 2001-2006, and disseminated the data report tostate legislators.  In partnership with IPAC, IPCS has worked to increase awareness among policymakers and residents of Hawai‘i about injuries as a major public health problem.  
/UIforwardIn 2008, IPCS released a series of “No Get Hurt” radio, television, and print ads with preventionmessages focused on different types of injuries that IPAC members helped to disseminate. 
/UIforwardRecognizing the significant percentage of Hawai‘i residents that are affiliated with the armedforces, IPCS has fostered partnerships with all five branches. There are military representativeson the Injury Prevention Advisory Committee (IPAC) and the Prevent Suicide Hawai‘i SteeringCommittee, and the military actively participates in the annual “Click It or Ticket” traffic safety campaign. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention9 Core CapacityRecommendations
Building on work completed for the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 , IPCS and the 
IPAC steering committee developed the following recommendations.  They are based on the core components of a state injury prevention program as identified by the Safe States Alliance (2003):  
/UIforwardBuild a solid infrastructure for injury and violence prevention
/UIforwardCollect and analyze injury and violence data
/UIforwardDesign, implement, and evaluate programs
/UIforwardProvide technical support and training
/UIforwardAffect public policy
Recommendation 1: Build and sustain infrastructure to provide leadership, data, technical 
assistance, and to support policy and evaluation for advancing injury prevention
Hawai‘i needs a strong, stable, and comprehensive program to systematically address the many causes of injury in coordination with multiple partners.  “CDC recommends that states adopt a comprehensiveinjury prevention program to provide consistent, reliable and comprehensive data for policymakers;ensure high-risk populations are identified and helped; lead state efforts among programs with variousinjury prevention goals; and provide continuity amid changing administrations and budget priorities”(Foreman, 2009).
The enactment of the Trauma System Special Fund by the Hawai‘i State Legislature in 2007 
provided for the development of a comprehensive statewide trauma system by the Department ofHealth.  A comprehensive trauma system addresses the problem of injury along the full continuum from primary prevention through acute care and rehabilitation. 
As a core component of this system, injury prevention will be more closely integrated with other
strategies that can reduce the severity and outcomes of injuries and IPCS will have access to resources to support positions and injury prevention initiatives.  The new hospital trauma centers that are alsopart of the trauma system can play a critical role in injury prevention activities by coordinating andsupporting injury prevention interventions in their communities.
Some hospitals have already instituted injury prevention interventions (e.g., policies that require
staff to follow safe sleep recommendations with infants and ensure that newborns leave hospitals inappropriate safety seats).  The establishment of trauma centers would allow hospitals to expand theirroles in injury prevention within their organizations and the community. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention10 Core CapacityRecommended Next Steps
/UIforwardSecure core IPCS positions under the Trauma System Special Fund.  
/UIforwardBuild professional capacity of Neighbor Island community partners to coordinate
community-based injury prevention interventions through conference trainings and distance-based learning.
/UIforwardImplement county level injury prevention interventions in coordination with trauma center staff and community stakeholders. 
Recommendation 2: Serve as a clearinghouse for data, and incorporate other injury data sources to
strengthen analyses and further injury prevention efforts
The Safe States Alliance recommends injury prevention programs maintain a strong data componentwith access to major data sources that define the injury problem (2003).  Complete, accurate, andtimely data are critical to informing public policies, guiding the selection, design and evaluation of interventions, and directing use of limited resources. 
Hawai‘i needs to build on its impressive achievements by maintaining and further enhancing the 
collection and distribution of injury prevention data.
Recommended Next Steps 
/UIforwardMaintain and increase use of standards for e-coding by emergency departments and hospitals, and evaluate the completeness of collected data.
/UIforwardEnsure continued access to currently used databases. 
/UIforwardExpand access to data sources.
Work with the Medical Examiner's Office to institutionalize access to autopsy records.
Access and use data from the statewide Trauma Registry.
/UIforwardImprove accessibility of reliable and timely injury data to partners. 
Provide partners Hawai‘i Emergency Medical Services Information System (HEMSIS) data
about risk factors such as seat belt use, alcohol and drug use, and helmet use.
Utilize internet to increase accessibility of data to partners, decision makers, and the public. 
Improve ability to respond to data requests quickly and effectively.Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention11 Core CapacityRecommendation 3: Provide training and technical assistance to increase and enhance knowledge
and skills among injury prevention practitioners and partners 
In order to effectively address injuries in Hawai‘i, it will be essential to build injury prevention core competencies among practitioners in related fields.  Core competencies include the ability to(Runyan & Stephens Stidham, 2009):
/UIforwardDescribe injury and violence as a public health problem
/UIforwardAccess, interpret, use, and present injury and violence data
/UIforwardDesign, implement, and evaluate injury prevention activities
/UIforwardDisseminate injury prevention information to the community and key policy makers
/UIforwardAffect change through policy and education
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardConduct a needs assessment to understand the training needs of professionals and partners, 
including practitioners and organizations working in related fields (e.g., first responders ) or specific content areas (e.g., water safety), as well as interested members of the community. At the same time, determine where and how the different groups prefer to receive training.
/UIforwardBased on results from the assessment, develop trainings to strengthen injury prevention and public health core competencies. 
/UIforwardExplore opportunities to provide these trainings in settings that maximize available resources.  
Use existing venues (e.g., IPAC meetings, injury specific and public health conferences). 
Provide annual training to trauma center staff.
/UIforwardIdentify and prioritize professionals and organizations that can have the greatest impact in 
reducing injuries, and develop tailored trainings that address their needs and interests. 
/UIforwardProvide partners specific training in applying evidence-based practices to help integrate injuryprevention into their work. 
/UIforwardSupport and pursue resources for professional development of injury prevention staff. 
Recommendation 4: Cultivate awareness among decision makers and the public to elevate injury
and violence as a major public health problem in Hawai ‘i
Injury prevention researchers, practitioners and advocates understand that injuries are a leading cause of death and disability that can be prevented.  Many decision makers and members of the public, however, continue to think of injuries as accidents that are unavoidable. 
It is imperative to communicate the personal and financial costs of injury as well as the potential 
solutions in order to inform policies, secure resources, change behaviors, and affect injury rates inHawai‘i.  Injury prevention advocates need to work with partners and the media to reach target audiences with carefully developed and tested messages.  Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention12 Core CapacityRecommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDevelop, test and disseminate injury prevention messages that are tailored to specific, 
prioritized audiences.
Disseminate messages developed by IPCS and the Fall Prevention Consortium (with training
and support from CDC's Injury Center Communications Initiative).  Identify and use commu-nication channels most frequently accessed and trusted by target audiences. 

Apply this message development process to other injury areas to create, test and disseminate 
additional messages.
/UIforwardDevelop materials that educate specific audiences, such as policy makers or employers, about 
priority injury areas.
/UIforwardSeek opportunities to communicate with the media about current issues, using relevant data andconsistent prevention messages. 
/UIforwardFacilitate partners’ ability to effectively communicate about injury by regularly providing current data and   information about evidence-based prevention strategies.
Use existing communication channels such as IPAC meetings and newsletters.
Recommendation 5: Inform injury prevention policy at all levels
Evidence-based policies implemented at national, state, local, and agency or organizational 
levels can dramatically reduce the burden of injury.  State legislation that requires children to ride in safety seats, local ordinances that require pool fencing, and health care provider policies that recommend fall risk assessments for all older clients are examples of policies that can help reduce injuries. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardWith leadership from IPAC and staff support from IPCS, develop and implement a 
comprehensive plan (with measurable goals and objectives) to work with partners and inform injury prevention policy at multiple levels. 
/UIforwardMobilize coalitions and networks to build a support base and advocate for evidence-based policy solutions.
/UIforwardContinue to identify, track, and share information about annual legislative injury prevention priorities. Core Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention13 Injury Specific RecommendationsCore Capacity to Sustain Injury Prevention
Recommendation 6: Increase opportunities for collaborative injury prevention efforts in all priority 
injury prevention areas
Working collaboratively with partners from diverse disciplines, organizations, and perspectives inside and outside of state government is critical to success.  To optimize the best use of limited resources, injury prevention partners need to coordinate efforts and address critical concerns without duplicating their efforts. 
Partnerships have been essential to the work of IPCS, as evidenced throughout this report.  They are
critical to directing priorities, communicating messages, and sustaining programs.

Background and Accomplishments
Drowning prevention has been a priority issue for the Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury 
Prevention and Cont rol Section (IPCS) since 1991 . H awai‘i has accomplished much in the area of
drowning prevention with the  bene fits of highly engaged experts, exceptional ocean safety officers 
across the state, active involvement from the visitor industry, and strong collaborative partnerships in the community. 
/UIforwardThe Hawai‘i Beach Safety website (www.hawaiibeachsafety.org) was developed in 2006 and provides beach ratings based on comprehensive risk assessments that were conducted on allguarded and unguarded beaches in the state.  The site also features safety information about hazards (e.g., rip currents, dangerous shore breaks), prevention tips, surf reports, special alerts(e.g., box jelly fish notices), and warnings. Information on the website is updated several timeseach day. Partners on this project include the Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services Division at the City and County of Honolulu, the Hawaiian Lifeguard Association, ocean safety and lifeguard partners on neighbor islands, the University of Hawai‘i School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, the Hawai‘i Tourism Authority, and the Hawai‘i State Department of Health. 
/UIforwardIn collaboration with the Hawai‘i Association of Independent Schools, IPCS co-produced thevideo, “Be Ocean Minded” about the Junior Lifeguard Program. Lifeguards    from all islands were interviewed to talk about ocean safety, prevention tips, and the value of the Junior Lifeguard Program.  The county-based Junior Lifeguard Program runs during the summer and trains teenagers (13-17 years of age) in ocean skills, beach condition assessment, and lifesaving techniques. The video serves as a recruitment tool for the program and copies have been distributed across the state.
/UIforwardIn 2009, IPCS surveyed over 500 beach goers on O‘ ahu, both residents and visitors, to assess the impact of four types of beach warning signs: strong current, high surf, dangerous shorebreak, and waves breaking on ledge. Results showed that about half of those surveyed saw the signs, and among those, 66% thought the signs would influence their behavior.
/UIforwardIPCS worked with the Swimming Pool Association of Hawai‘i in 2009 to conduct a survey of1 ,300 residential pool owners on O‘ ahu.  The impetus for this project was to inform pool ownersabout a federal law designed to protect children against entrapment from the suction of pooldrains and pumps. This 2009 law, the Virginia Graeme-Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, ismandatory for commercial pools but not for residential pools.  The survey asked about drain covers and pumps as well as fencing, safety latches on gates, whether there were kids in theirhome and if so, whether the kids participated in swimming lessons.  Pool owners also were provided with pool safety and entrapment prevention information.  A follow-up survey determined what safety changes pool owners made.  During the survey, 163 swimming pools or spas were identified as having potentially dangerous equipment; 65 pool owners voluntarily upgraded their pumps and drains. 15 Injury Specific RecommendationsDrowning Prevention
Recommendations
In 2010, IPCS led a statewide needs assessment that included 
a review of best practices for drowning prevention, in-depthtelephone interviews with ten key stakeholders (i.e., represen-tatives of organizations involved in prevention efforts, and potential partners), and two strategic planning sessions withpartners from the community and the visitor industry.  IPCSused the information gathered through this process to developand prioritize the following recommendations. 
Recommendation 1: Establish a task force to develop a
statewide approach to drowning prevention
Each week in Hawai‘i, at least one person fatally drowns.  As anisland state, it is essential that we c reate a safer environment
and provide residents and tourists with information they needto have a safe and enjoyable experience in and around the water.
A statewide task force for drowning prevention would bring keypartners together to coordinate drowning prevention efforts,and provide guidance to IPCS moving forward. Partners in thecommunity, including the visitor industry should be broadly
represented on the task force, and efforts should be made to engage educators. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardWork with existing groups, including the Hawai‘i  Department of Land and Natural Resources and the
Hawaiian Lifeguard A ssociation to create a task force, 
build membership and define a clear mission.
Recommendation 2: Implement a statewide educational 
campaign to increase ocean safety awareness among residents
and visitors
The majority of drownings in Hawai‘i are ocean-related, and half of those fatalities are among tourists.  Clear and effectivemessages for resi dents and visitors of Hawai‘i need to be 
developed, tested, implemented, and evaluated.  Messages may be communicated through existing communication channels, including the Hawai‘i Beach Safety website and the Hawai‘iTourism Authority’s Travel Smart Hawai‘i website.  Effortsshould be made to engage partners throughout the message development and dissemination process. PARTNERS

Attention also must be paid to visitors’ sources of information. Hawai‘i guidebooks are of particular 
concern as they often direct visitors who are less familiar with ocean swimming and conditions to unguarded locations without explaining the potential dangers. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardSolicit partner input to develop and test clear, consistent prevention messages for visitors 
and residents.
/UIforwardEngage partners in message dissemination and evaluation.
/UIforwardEducate writers and publishers of guidebooks about drownings in H awai‘i and encourage them 
to include accurate information in their publications about safety conditions.
Recommendation 3: Evaluate current drowning prevention efforts and disseminate information about
best practices
Drowning prevention is a complex public health concern. There are numerous factors including theage and ability of the individual, the body of water (e.g., swimming pool, ocean, stream), and currentconditions (Quan, et al, 2007). More information is needed about what works to prevent drowning in Hawai‘i. 
Currently, there aren’t many evidence-based strategies or best practices to prevent drowning. There
are several promising practices that have strong behavioral elements, and very few environmental orlegislative interventions.  More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions andeducation materials currently in use (Quan, et al, 2007). Results from such research would help solicitsupport from partners and policy makers, and inform decisions about resource allocation. 
Equally important to completing the research will be disseminating information about best and promising
practices to key audiences in the state as well as the broader drowning prevention community. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardEvaluate the Hawai‘i Beach Safety website, www.hawaiibeachsafety.org, to determine effectiveness and use
of the site.
/UIforwardProvide data support and technical assistance to practitioners that need assistance evaluating theirown drowning prevention programs. 
/UIforwardEvaluate effectiveness of safety efforts, including the provision of rescue tubes, at unguarded beaches across the state.
/UIforwardDisseminate information about effective safety efforts in Hawai‘i through partner organizations. 17 Injury Specific RecommendationsDrowning Prevention
Injury Data for Drownings (residents and non-residents)
Fatal injuries
There was no clear trend in the annual number of drownings, although the 79 deaths in 2011 was 
the highest total since at least 1993.  Most of the high total in 2011 was due to drownings on Honoluluand Maui counties. About half (53%) of the victims were Hawai‘i residents, 36% from the U.S. mainland,and 12% from foreign countries.  The ages of the victims were widely distributed, although only 8%were under 18 years of age.  Almost all (83%) were males.  About half (47%) of all the victims drownedon O‘ ahu .  If only drownings among Hawai‘i residents were considered, O‘ ahu residents had the lowest rates, significantly lower than rates for Neighbor Island residents as a whole.  If non-residentsare also included, the highest (unadjusted) rate was computed for Kaua‘i, approximately twice ashigh as rates for Hawai‘i County and more than 3 times the rates for Honolulu County (the island of O‘ ahu).  
Most (78%, or 259) of the victims drowned in the ocean or saltwater environments, almost all of 
whom (96%) were 18 years or older.  Unintentional immersions led to 13% of these drownings, including 31 victims who fell in or were swept into the ocean.  Other common activities were swimming (29% of victims), snorkeling (22%), and free diving (9%).  According to autopsy records, intrinsic or personal factors contributed to over half (61%) of the saltwater drownings in HonoluluCounty from 2007 to 2010.  The most common intrinsic factor was circulatory diseases, presentamong 46% of the victims of all ages, and 69% of those aged 50 years and older.  Only 13% of the victims tested positive for alcohol, and only 7% had BAC (blood alcohol content) levels of 0.08% orgreater.  Illicit drug use was considered a contribution to 12% of the drownings.  Apart from oceandrownings, there were 36 drownings in swimming pools, 21 in rivers and streams, and 12 in bathtubs.  Only 3 (8%) of the 36 victims who drowned in swimming pools were under 5 years of age, as victim age was widely distributed in this environment.  Trend: no trend

Nonfatal injuries (near drownings)
There was no clear trend in the annual number of near drownings, which averaged 235 per year.
Hawai‘i residents comprised a slight majority (55%) of all patients treated for near drownings, butonly 41% of those who were hospitalized.  ED (emergency  department) patients were significantlyyounger on average than those who were hospitalized (31 vs. 40 years of age), with more than half(56%) in the 15 to 44 year age group.  Among Hawai‘i residents, county-specific rate estimates weregenerally comparable except for Hawai‘i and Maui county residents.  
Hospitalizations were of a relatively short number of days (4. 1 , on average), but because each 
hospitalization incurred over $28,000 in charges, they comprised most (91%) of the total $2.3 millionin annual medical charges related to drowning.  Swimming (40%) and “surfing, windsurfing andboogie boarding” (32%) were the most common activities for the patients overall, although swimmingwas a more likely cause among non-residents (45%), while the latter activities were more commonamong residents (39%).  
EMS data
Almost all (94%) of the incidents EMS responded to occurred during day time hours, including 80%between 9:31 a.m. and 5:29 p.m.  More than half (59%) of the patients were Hawai‘i residents.  About43% of the near drownings occurred in bodies of water, which could include both freshwater andsaltwater environments.  About one-third (30%) were in patient residences (10%), public buildings(12%), hotels (5%), and health care facilities (3%).  Most (77%) of the patients were either transportedin “serious” (46%) or “ critical” (32%) condition, with no significant differences in the distribution ofpatient condition between residents and non-residents.  Probable alcohol use was noted for only 4%of the patients.  Near drownings  that occurred during night time hours were significantly morelikely to involve alcohol consumption than day time incidents, however (21% vs. 3%).  
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Only 8% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry  near drowning patients
were positive for alcohol, and only 9% tested positive for illicit drugs, although there was no toxico-logical testing for about two-thirds of the patients.  Substance use was somewhat higher among resident patients, although this comparison is limited by the small sample sizes and the lack of testing.Trend: no trend

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has been
working with partners in the community to prevent falls among older adults for nearly a decade. 
/UIforwardIn 2003, IPCS supported the establishment of the Hawai‘i Fall Prevention Consortium 
which provides a forum for information sharing, collaboration on fall prevention activities, and promotion of best practices for reducing falls among older adults.  Members represent government agencies, professional associations, non-profit organizations, hospitals, care facilities, and senior organizations. 
/UIforwardStatewide conferences on fall prevention, held in 2005 and 2007, featured nationally recognizedleaders in the field.
/UIforwardIn 2009, a Tai Chi for Health intervention was successfully piloted at Pohai Nani Care Facility.IPCS sponsored a similar intervention at Leahi Hospital in 2011 .
/UIforwardEducational materials were developed and distributed to raise awareness about fall preventionand fall prevention information, including a fall prevention directory of services and resources,was added to the state injury prevention website www.nogethurt.hawaii.gov.  
/UIforwardIn partnership with the Fall Prevention Consortium, IPCS facilitated fall prevention screening for balance by physical and occupational therapists and medication reviews by pharmacistsstatewide as part of annual fall prevention awareness activities.
/UIforwardThe State Executive Office on Aging and county Area Agencies on Aging used data collected byIPCS to inform their 2011-2015 State and Area Plans on Aging.  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , the Executive Office on Aging and IPCS partnered to establish the Hawai‘i State Fall Prevention Task Force.  This short-term, volunteer Task Force comprised of key stakeholders isdeveloping a comprehensive statewide approach to fall prevention by December 2012 that willaddress recommendations in this report.
/UIforwardThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) selected IPCS as one of three states to participate in an injury prevention message development and framing initiative.  In 2010, IPCS,members of the Fall Prevention Consortium, and other community partners engaged in training to develop a coordinated communication strategy for fall prevention.  Participants developed messages for independent older adults that IPCS tested, and the Fall Prevention Consortium is coordinating final revisions and dissemination.20 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Recommendations
In 2010, a statewide needs assessment was conducted that 
included a literature review, an online survey of more than 200 fall prevention professionals and community members,and follow-up telephone interviews with 58 key informants.IPCS, together with the Fall Prevention Consortium and other partners, used the results from this needs assessment as thebasis for the following recommendations.  
Recommendation 1: Raise awareness about fall prevention
among older adults, caregivers, and providers
Enhance awareness among the public, older adults, caregivers,and providers that falls can be prevented and promote adoptionof four key prevention behaviors:
/UIforwardBeginning a regular exercise program 
/UIforwardHaving one’s health care provider review medicines
/UIforwardHaving one’s vision checked
/UIforwardMaking one's home safer
The scientific literature and the June 2010 survey of key 
informants in Hawai‘i confirmed that many older adults areunaware of their increased risk of falling or the simple stepsthey can take to reduce their risk (World Health Organization(WHO), 2007).
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDisseminate previously developed and tested messages 
for older adults.
/UIforwardDevelop and test additional clear, audience-specific mes-sages for care givers, pharmacists, and physicians.
/UIforwardIdentify and use appropriate communication channels toreach key audiences.
/UIforwardDistribute messages through community partners, including Fall Prevention Consortium members.
/UIforwardDevelop a packet of fall prevention educational materials tobe distributed through partners.PARTNERS

Recommendation 2: Increase availability and accessibility of fall prevention programs statewide
Fall prevention programs can help older adults:
/UIforwardAssess balance and strength
/UIforwardExercise to increase their strength and balance
/UIforwardGet their medications reviewed and adjusted at least annually
/UIforwardAssess and modify their homes to reduce fall hazards 
/UIforwardCheck for and correct vision impairments
The scientific literature has shown these activities can reduce the risk of falling, and there are various
fall prevention programs available in the state (WHO, 2007).  These programs are not, however, availableacross all islands and in all communities. In addition, these services are not always covered by insurance;for example, Medicare does not pay for eye glasses.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardExpand exercise programs tailored to increase balance and strength such as Enhanced Fitness, 
Tai Chi, and No Fear of Falling. 
/UIforwardIncrease the availability and use of successful home safety assessment programs. 
/UIforwardDevelop strategies to coordinate services among venues where older adults gather, such as community clinics, senior centers, meal sites, senior housing, assisted living facilities, care homes, day health centers, shopping centers, schools, and churches.
/UIforwardDevelop and disseminate an updated fall prevention resource guide to supplement current materialsproduced by the Area Agencies on Aging and the Adult Disability Resources Centers (ADRC). 
/UIforwardExplore resources to print translations of educational materials.  Languages might include Ilocano,Tagalog, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean.
Recommendation 3: Engage professionals and community members in fall prevention activities
Develop fall prevention activities that engage: 
/UIforwardPublic workers (e.g., paramedics, fire fighters, public health nurses, Area Agency on Aging staff)
/UIforwardHealth care providers, elder care providers, ADRC staff members, program trainers (e.g., physicians,nurses, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacists)
/UIforwardCoalitions (e.g., Fall Prevention Consortium, the Hawai‘i Healthy Aging Program)
/UIforwardNon-profit organizations (e.g., AARP, YMCA)
/UIforwardInterested individuals (e.g., retired workers, volunteers)
Many individuals and organizations must join together to prevent falls in Hawai‘i.  Already, paramedics
and some pharmacists provide medication reviews, and many hospitals and rehabilitation programs assist with home assessments and modifications.  But more individuals and organizations can, andshould be enlisted in the cause. 22 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Recommended Next Steps
Develop mutually beneficial partnerships with groups to facilitate fall prevention activities, for example:
/UIforwardEncourage community partners, such as fire departments and EMS providers to assist with 
home assessments.
/UIforwardEnable more pharmacists and other qualified professionals to provide free annual medication reviews.
/UIforwardEncourage medical professionals to provide fall risk assessments.
/UIforwardTrain care home providers to lead exercise programs for their residents. 
/UIforwardEngage and support students in professional schools by:
Training occupational and physical therapy assistants to certify eldercare providers 
in senior-friendly exercise programs.
Enlisting medical and pharmacy students to assist with medication reviews.
Training nurses, certified nurse aid students, and certified medical assistants in 
home assessment.
/UIforwardWork with partners to develop and implement a training program and tool kit to educate all healthcare providers about the special needs of older adults and fall prevention strategies.
/UIforwardEngage new and current members of the Fall Prevention Consortium, including representativesfrom the Aging Network, to achieve identified priorities. 
Injury Data for Falls
Fatal injuries
Falls were the most common type of fatal unintentional injury in the state, with the 541 deaths accounting for 25% of the total.  More than three-quarters (79%) of the victims were aged 65 years orolder, and the risk of fatal falls increased dramatically across the senior age range.  Males comprisedthe majority (78%) of victims under 65 years of age, while gender was more equally distributed forthe senior-aged victims.  Honolulu County residentscomprised most of the victims of all ages (77%)and those who were 65 years or older (81%).  The fall fatality rate estimate for senior-aged residentsof Honolulu County was significantly higher than the rates for residents of Kaua‘i or Maui counties,and 45% higher than for Neighbor Island residents considered as a whole.

F23 Injury Specific RecommendationsPreventing Falls Among Older Adults
Death certificates provided little information on the causes of falls, as most were coded as “falls on the
same level” with no further description (48%), or “unspecified” causes (32%).  Falls from stairs or steps
were the most specifically coded cause, but comprised only 4% of the total.  More than half (61%) of the
falls occurred at the residence of the victim, including 68% of the senior-aged victims.  
Nonfatal injuries
Falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injuries among Hawai‘i residents, with nearly 21 ,000 ED(emergency department) visits and over 2,700 hospitalizations each year.  The annual number of injuries generally increased.  Children aged 1 to 14 years comprised 27% of all patients, but abouttwo-thirds (68%) of those who were hospitalized were 65 years or older.  Gender was equally distributedamong patients treated in EDs, but females comprised 59% of the patients that were hospitalized. 
Residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal injuries from falls
than residents of Honolulu and Maui counties.  The residents of Honolulu County had the lowestrates of hospitalizations. Among the more specifically coded injuries, the most common causes werefalls from stairs, steps and escalators (5.3% of the total), beds (3.7%), skateboards (3.5%), and chairs,playground equipment, and ladders (about 2% for each).  At least half (53%) of the falls that causedhospitalizations in seniors occurred in home environments.  This proportion increases to 84% if onlyrecords with specific information on location are considered.  The most common activity related tothe falls was “walking, marching and hiking”, accounting for 30% of the total.  Skateboarding, running,tackle football, and bathing and showering were also prominent activities.  Hospitalizations averagednearly 1 week in duration, resulted in over $31 ,000 in medical charges, and accounted for 72% ($84million) of the total annual charges of $116.6 million related to falls.  Fractures were present innearly three-fourths (74%) of the hospitalized patients, including 29% with hip fractures.  Trend: increasing trend

More than half (57%) of the EMS-attended falls occurred in the home or residence of the patient, and
this proportion was significantly higher among the seniors (71%) compared to younger aged patients(41%).  More than half (54%) of the patients were 65 years or older, including 22% who were 85 yearsor older.  Senior-aged patients had worse dispositions, as they were more likely to be transported in
serious condition (49%, compared to 40% of younger age patients) and less likely to be released at thescene (12% vs 19%, respectively).  Probable alcohol use was noted 8% of the patients, and male patients were more than twice as likely to have used alcohol compared to females (12% vs. 5%).  
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Only 11% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry resident patients who were
injured by falls were positive for alcohol, with 4 times higher use among patients in the 18 to 64 yearage group (19%), compared to senior-aged patients (5%).  Fifteen percent of the patients tested positivefor illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (11%).  Considered together, about one-quarter (24%, or
587) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, although that proportion was much
lower among the senior-aged patients (13%), compared to younger patients (36%).

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has collaborated
with partners to address different types of poisonings among different populations.
/UIforwardIPCS strongly supports the Keiki Injury Prevention Coalition (KIPC) in their ongoing efforts to 
prevent poisoning. 
In 2009, KIPC received a grant from the Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture related to the 
recognition and management of pesticide-related injuries.  KIPC has conducted poisoning prevention education and outreach activities for the public to increase awareness of householdpesticide exposures and reduce exposures in and around households.
KIPC works to raise public awareness about, and increase use of, the 24 hour Hawai‘i poison 
control hotline for information about potential poisonings and medications.   
/UIforwardIn 2010, IPCS began serving as a clearinghouse to disseminate poisoning prevention materials tocommunity partners.  Materials disseminated to pediatricians, preschools, hospitals, and health care clinics on all islands include magnets and stickers to promote the Hawai‘i poison control hotline, poisoning prevention information fact sheets,  “No Get Hurt” poisoning prevention posters,and information on the correct use of pesticides from the Department of Agriculture.
As part of the “No Get Hurt” campaign, IPCS printed poisoning prevention posters in 2010 for 
use by the Department of Health Women Infant and Children (WIC) Services Branch and othercommunity partners.
/UIforwardIPCS collaborated with a community partner to analyze data about poisonings from opioids inHonolulu County between 2004-2008.  The results of this analysis showed the most common way to access opiates was through a personal prescription (46% of the victims).  Only a minority of victimsaccessed opiates through prescriptions written for other people (4%), or purchased drugs illicitly(4%). However, access to opiates was not known for a large proportion (41%) of the victims, limitingthe reliability of this data source.
/UIforwardIn 1992, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) established Hawai‘i’s Prescription Drug Monitoring System (PDM) - one of the best practices for determining misuse and abuse of controlled substances. In 2012, improvements were made to the program to ensure the PDM database is effectively used and maintained. In addition to maintaining the PDM system, DPS is required to “ carry out educational programs designed to prevent and determine misuse and abuse of controlled substances” (HRS 329-58).  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , IPCS began collaborating with state and community organizations working on STD/AIDS and substance
abuse prevention in an effort to understand and address the 
increase in prescription drug overdoses. 26 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
Recommendations
While poisoning among children has decreased with interventions such as childproof caps, the past few
years have revealed dramatic increases in prescription drug overdoses (CDC, 2011b). IPCS analyzedtrend data for poisoning fatalities and injuries, including prescription drug overdoses, and conducted a comprehensive review of current best practices. Results from this analysis formed the basis for the recommendations below. 
IPCS first presented results of the analysis to the Department of Health, STD/AIDS Prevention
Branch and the CHOW Project (The Community Health Outreach Work to Prevent AIDS Project), which were subsequently shared with the Hawai‘i Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and 
Controlled Substances (HACDACS).  As set forth by the Legislature, HACDACS is the primary advisory body to the Departments of Public Safety and Health and to the Legislature, and an appropriate partner to support in developing policy changes for the prevention of prescription drug overdoses.
Partners from public and private sectors (e.g., public safety, insurance, medicine, pharmacology, 
substance abuse treatment, law enforcement) can all help reduce poisonings, especially prescriptiondrug overdoses, in Hawai‘i.
Recommendation 1: Enhance use of data resources to understand the problem of prescription drug
overdoses in Hawai ‘i and facilitate prevention efforts
To better address the issue of prescription drug overdoses, more data and analyses are necessary.Death certificates describe an overall increasing trend but provide limited data on the type of drugscausing deaths. Autopsy data provides more information about deaths due to prescription drugs, including the specific substances involved and whether victims accessed drugs through legal or illegal means, although information about access is missing from a significant proportion of autopsyrecords.  Therefore, linking autopsy data with the PDM database would help describe access to thespecific substances involved in overdoses and provide a clearer picture of drug overdose fatalities in Hawai‘i. 
Additional data sources such as survey-based data and fatality reviews that go beyond information
gathered for autopsy reviews, would add to the body of knowledge about prescription drug use andpractices, and help identify risk factors and effective prevention measures. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardDetermine ability to gain access to the Department of Public Safety’s PDM database and other state
agencies' data related to drug poisoning (Medicaid, workers’ compensation data).
/UIforwardLink death certificate and autopsy records with the PDM database to learn more about decedents’ access to drugs.
/UIforwardUse additional data sources to describe general drug use and poisoning in the population and indicate areas for further research (i.e., Hawai‘i Health Information Center, Trauma Registry, Poison Center Data, Behavioral Risk Factor System Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Survey).27 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
/UIforwardProvide comprehensive data and injury prevention expertise to support partnerships and strategies
for addressing prescription drug overdoses.  Key partners include:
The Hawai‘i Advisory Commission on Drug Abuse and Controlled Substances
Hawai‘i State Department of Health Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division
Hawai‘i State Department of Health STD/AIDs Branch
The CHOW Project (The Community Health Outreach Work to Prevent AIDS Project)
Hawai‘i Substance Abuse Coalition
Hawai‘i State Department of Public Safety
Hospitals and trauma centers
First responders 
County police departments
Physicians and pharmacists
Insurance companies
Community organizations
Recommendation 2:  Identify and support enactment of policies and practices that reduce both 
inappropriate and illegal prescribing, and evaluate their effectiveness
Promising policies and practices target the prescribing practices of health care providers to help preventprescription drug abuses and overdoses while allowing safe and effective pain management.  These include prescription drug monitoring programs, patient review and restriction programs, health careprovider accountability, laws and education to prevent prescription drug abuse and diversion, and better access to substance abuse treatment, including risk reduction strategies and education.  Increasing capacity of pharmacists and other prescribers to educate patients about overdose can alsoleverage prevention efforts.  These interventions need to be evaluated locally to determine their effectiveness in reducing prescription drug overdose deaths (CDC, 2011b).   
States play key roles in regulating the use of prescription drugs and the practices of prescribers and pharmacists, and in financing and regulating health care for people with Medicaid - a group at greater risk for overdose (CDC, 2011a).
State agencies need to work in partnership with organizations in the private sector from health care andrelated fields to bring about changes in organizational practices.  Implementing screening and briefintervention  and ref erral and treatment pr otocols in state-funded trauma centers, and adding screening
for potential misuse and abuse of prescription drugs can serve as a model practice for other hospitals andhealth care systems to adopt.  As important potential users of the PDM database, emergency physiciansare one of the key partners in prescription drug overdose prevention efforts.  28 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardCollaborate with the Department of Public Safety to support and evaluate use of the Hawai‘i 
Prescription Drug Monitoring System.
/UIforwardWork with organizations such as the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Hawai‘i  Medical Association, Hawai‘i pharmacy associations, health care systems, and legislators to developand enact policies that support prescribing practices to reduce prescription drug misuse and abuse.
/UIforwardCollaborate with state-funded trauma centers across the state to adapt screening and brief intervention practices that identify potential prescription misuse and abuse problems.  Developpolicies to support the intervention and share them with other health care settings as a model for implementing similar interventions (Ohio Injury Prevention Partnership, 2010). 
/UIforwardCollaborate with the Hawai‘i Board of Pharmacy, the Hawai‘i Pharmacists Association, and theHawai‘i Community Pharmacists Association to identify and promote educational strategies forpharmacists to help regulate the use of prescription drugs.  
/UIforwardPartner with insurance companies, and physician and pharmacy associations to educate the publicon the potential misuse of drugs received from friends and family.
/UIforwardSupport risk reduction training for first responders, health care providers, and other serviceproviders to reduce the risk of death from opioid overdoses.
Recommendation 3: Support primary poisoning prevention education and maintenance of the 
poison information hotline
Poisoning prevention education and the poison information hotline encourage appropriate actions thatcan reduce poisoning injuries, fatalities, and their associated hospital and health care costs.  In additionto responding to calls for diagnostic or treatment recommendations on poison exposure for which callerswould otherwise go to the emergency department, health care providers rely on the hotline for toxicologyexpertise in handling severe overdoses.  The poison hotline also identifies and alerts the public to poisoningtrends, and provides a drug identification service to callers that reduces drug errors from improper useof medications. 
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardContinue collaborating with KIPC to provide educational materials and promote the poison 
information hotline.  
/UIforwardUse data collected from the poison information hotline to identify trends and problem areas and inform prevention strategies.
/UIforwardHelp secure continued funding for the poison information hotline.29 Injury Specific RecommendationsPoisoning Prevention
Injury Data for Poisonings
Fatal injuries
There was an increasing trend in the annual number of unintentional poisonings.  (There was no
consistent trend in the number of poisonings of undetermined intent over this period.)  Victim agewas narrowly distributed, as 58% were in the 45 to 64 year age range.  Males comprised 78% of the victims.  Most (82%) of the victims were poisoned on O‘ ahu, and the highest fatality rates were computed for Honolulu County residents.  Inclusion of poisonings of undetermined intent resulted in significantly lower rates among O‘ ahu residents compared to Hawai‘i or Maui county residents, so these comparisons are unreliable.  Drugs caused almost all (93%) of the poisonings, including 32% from “narcotics and hallucinogens” and 34% from “sedative-hypnotic and psychotropic drugs”.

There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal poisonings, but this was evident only for 
ED (emergency department) visits among Honolulu and Maui county residents.  Gender was nearlyequally distributed with 53% male patients.  Patient age was broadly distributed, although one-quarter (26%) were 1 to 14 years of age.  Seniors comprised only 13% of all patients, but (23%) ofthose who were hospitalized.  Rates of ED visits were highest by far for residents under 5 years of age, nearly 5 times higher than the rate for all other age groups.  Residents of Honolulu and Mauicounties had comparable injury rates, significantly lower than the rates for residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties. 
Patients were hospitalized for slightly over 3 days on average, with nearly $18,000 in medical charges 
related to poisoning.  Most (76%) of the poisonings were caused by drugs or medicinal substances,including 92% of those that required hospitalization.  Narcotics caused 21% of the hospitalizations,tranquilizers 13%, aromatic analgesics (which include acetaminophen, or Tylenol) 8%, and cardiovascular agents 8%.  Poisoning Prevention

The Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has led suicide prevention activities within the
Hawai‘i State Department of Health since 2005 with support from the Child and Adolescent MentalHealth Division, the Adult Mental Health Division, and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division.
/UIforwardThe Prevent Suicide Hawai‘i Task Force (PSHTF) has chapters in each county and includes morethan 100 members representing a broad network of agencies and stakeholders.  PSHTF providesguidance to IPCS related to suicide prevention programming and activities.  PSHTF grew out of the
Suicide Prevention Task Force that was initiated in 2000 by the Department of Health, Maternal and Child Health Branch.
/UIforwardIn 2006, IPCS secured funds for a permanent suicide prevention coordinator to lead and implementinitiatives based on the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and the Hawai‘i State Plan for Suicide Prevention. 
/UIforwardWith an established PSHTF and suicide prevention coordinator, suicide prevention gatekeepertrainings began to be offered statewide to representatives from health and human services, education,emergency services, faith-based organizations and the general public.  Trainings included:
ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) – a two-day intensive training 
program to help participants identify and assess the risk of individuals in crisis and provide
early intervention and referral to reduce the risk.
safeTALK – a three hour suicide intervention training that prepares participants to identify 
persons with thoughts of suicide and connect them to suicide prevention first aid resources.
/UIforwardIn 2007, legislation was passed to support a youth prevention program with $100,000 annually.IPCS used these funds, in collaboration with PSHTF, to build a statewide network of public andcommunity partnerships with task forces on each island, to build public awareness and to increaseprofessional and community capacity for responding to individuals at risk for suicide through gatekeeper training. 
/UIforwardIn 2008, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration awarded IPCS fundingthrough the Garrett Lee Smith grant. The 3-year federal award provided $500,000 annually tosupport continued implementation and evaluation of ASIST and safeTALK trainings and a pilot ofthe Signs of Suicide training for t eachers and students.  These gatekeeper trainings focused on youth,
partnering with three agencies: Honolulu Police Department; Department of Education; Departmentof Health, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Division.  
/UIforwardIn 2011 , the Sustainability Plan for Suicide Prevention Training in Hawai‘i was developed to 
address gatekeeper training needs for the future.  The plan was built on previous efforts and community partnerships.  
Recommendations
The following recommendations were informed by a needs assessment of 500 key stakeholders, includingPSHTF members, ASIST trainers and other partners, and additional input was provided by PSHTF sub-committee chairs. IPCS, together with the PSHTF and other partners, agreed to continue expanding effortshighlighted in the 
Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010 . The national Suicide Prevention Resource
Center supports these recommendations. Suicide Prevention32 Injury Specific RecommendationsSuicide Prevention
Recommendation 1:  Enhance ongoing suicide prevention trainings for gatekeepers
A “gatekeeper” can be any individual who interacts with others at work, in schools, at play, at home, or 
in community settings (i.e., other than clinical settings).  Gatekeepers trained in suicide prevention and
intervention learn to:
/UIforwardRecognize early signs of suicidal behavior
/UIforwardImplement timely and effective intervention strategies
/UIforwardIdentify opportunities to reinforce protective factors
/UIforwardIntervene in crisis situations
/UIforwardRefer people to appropriate professionals, or “ open the gate” to mental health services
Training gatekeepers is considered a best practice among suicide prevention professionals. Evaluation of
ASIST trainings has described positive gains in trainees’ self-rated capacity to identify, assess, and referpotentially suicidal people, both immediately after the ASIST training, and approximately one year after.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardContinue evaluation of gatekeeper training programs to determine which approaches are most 
effective across different settings.
/UIforwardContinue providing culturally competent trainings to increase the number of gatekeepers in thecommunity.
Specific attention should be paid to training gatekeepers that reach underserved populations, 
including youth, seniors, the homeless, those who are incarcerated, adults with mental healthchallenges, and ind ividuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered.

Recommendation 2: Develop and implement a public awareness campaign
The stigma associated with suicide has been recognized as a barrier to treatment for many people who are having suicidal thoughts or who have made previous suicide attempts. Lives can be savedthrough public understanding that suicides are preventable and that individuals and groups can play a significant role in suicide prevention.
A statewide public awareness campaign would aim to increase awareness about suicide as a serious
public health problem, dispel myths, and decrease stigma related to suicide.  Messages and materialswould support a shift in beliefs, promote help-seeking behavior, and publicize available prevention, intervention, and aftercare services in the community.

Injury Data for Suicides and suicide attempts
Fatal injuries
There was a generally increasing trend in the number of suicides in the state, and the 195 deaths in 2010was by far the highest total in the 21-year period (1991-2011) for which data was available.  Victimage was widely distributed, although almost all (95%) were 19 years or older.  The highest fatalityrates were computed for residents aged 45 to 54 years and those 85 years and older.  Male victimsoutnumbered females by approximately 3-to-1 .  More than half (58%) of the victims were residents ofO‘ ahu, but the fatality rate for O‘ ahu (58/100,000 residents) was significantly lower than the rate for thecombined Neighbor Islands (94/100,000).  
The most common mechanism was by hanging or suffocation (49% of the suicides), followed by
firearm use (20%).  Most (65%) of the O‘ ahu victims had a documented history of mental illness (asvariously defined), according to autopsy records from 2007 to 2010.  The most common negative lifeevents for the victims were related to intimate relationship problems (34%), usually a break-up or divorce (12%), or serious illness or medical issues (26%).  The latter was documented for 60% of thesenior-aged victims.  Over one-third (37%) had a history of substance abuse, 19% had a BAC  (bloodalcohol content) level over 0.08%, and 34% tested positive for illicit drugs.  Nearly one-third (32%) ofthe victims had a previous suicide attempt documented in the record, and more than half (56%) hadverbally threatened suicide.  Trend: increasing

Nonfatal injuries
There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal suicide attempts, which was only evident in 
the annual number of injuries that were treated in EDs (emergency departments).  Slightly morethan half (56%) of the injuries were treated in EDs, unlike most types of injuries.  Most (58%) of thepatients were under 35 years of age, and residents aged 15 to 19 years had the highest rates of hospital-izations and especially ED visits.  The gender distribution of patients was similar for both settings, withfemales comprising 57% of the total.
Residents of Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal self-inflicted 
injuries compared to residents of Honolulu and Maui counties.  Over half (58%) of the ED visits andmost (85%) of the hospitalizations were caused by poisonings from drugs or medicinal substances,most commonly from the “ analgesics, antipyretics, and antirheumatics” class (22% of ED visits, 33% of hospitalizations), which includes both narcotics (heroin, and other opiates), as well as aspirin and acetaminophen.

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) has worked in
traffic safety for more than twenty years.  Since 2005, IPCS has strengthened relationships with state,county and community 
traffic safety partners through its commitment to the development, implementation
and evaluation of the Department of Transportation’s Hawai‘i Strategic Highway Safety Plan .  
/UIforwardIPCS supported and evaluated the Graduated Driver’s Licensing (GDL) legislation that was 
enacted in 2006. In 2010, data from the evaluation led to removal of the sunset clause, making GDL permanent in Hawai‘i .  
/UIforwardWith support and testimony provided by IPCS and traffic safety partners, Hawai‘i  passed an ignitioninterlock law in 2008 that took effect January 2010. The use of ignition interlocks, an evidence-based strategy to prevent alcohol-impaired driving, has been proven to reduce re-arrest rates.  
/UIforwardIn partnership with the Department of Transportation (DOT), IPCS annually supports the nationwide “Click It or Ticket” Campaign – an enhanced enforcement program shown to increasesafety belt use. 
/UIforwardIPCS assists with quality assurance of the traffic safety data collected in real time from EmergencyMedical Services (EMS) personnel across the state in the Hawai‘i  Emergency Medical Services Information System (HEMSIS). HEMSIS is an integral part of the statewide trauma system that theDepartment of Health EMS Branch established. 
/UIforwardWith the support of the DOT, the Keiki Injury Prevention Coalition (KIPC) has established regularsafety check up sites and a network of trained technicians, including child passenger services forchildren with special health needs.
/UIforwardIPCS provides data and technical support to numerous traffic safety partners across the state. 
Recommendations
The following recommendations were prioritized based on results from a statewide survey of 45 state,
county and community traffic safety partners.  This survey included a list of evidence-based program and
policy recommendations, many of which are in the Hawai‘i Strategic Highway Safety Plan .
Motorcycle and Moped Safety
Recommendation 1: Increase helmet use among motorcycle and moped riders by supporting a 
universal moped and motorcycle helmet law
Properly worn helmets prevent deaths and brain injuries. In the event of a crash, helmets reduce the risk of death by 42% and the risk of a head injury by 69% (Liu, et al. 2008).  States that have enacteduniversal helmet laws have seen significant reductions in fatality rates, head injuries and overall medical expenses related to motorcycle injuries (NHTSA 2011). 
In 1968, Hawai‘i enacted a universal helmet law under a federal mandate; it was repealed in 1977. 
Between 1968-1976, motorcycle fatalities in Hawai‘i decreased by 57% (6 per 10,000 registered motorcycles bet ween 19 68-1976 vs. 14 per 10,000 reg istered motorcycles prior to 1968 and after 
the repeal in 1977; NHTSA, 2012). 37 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety
Hawai‘i currently has a partial helmet statute that requires riders
under the age of 18 to wear a helmet. States with universal helmetlaws have motorcycle rider fatality rates that were 20-40% lowerthan states with partial helmet laws (Ulmer & Preusser, 2003).
In Hawai‘i from 2005-2009, more than two thirds (67%) of 
fatally injured motorcycle riders and almost all (96%) of fatallyinjured moped riders were not wearing a helmet at the time ofthe crash; and nearly half (47%) of motorcycle riders and 86% ofmoped riders were not wearing a helmet in non-fatal crashes(NHTSA 2012). Medical costs of helmeted riders average 67%lower than that of un-helmeted riders (Queen’s Hospital Financial System data, 2005-2007).  Currently Medicaid,Medicare, and Quest pay 22.5% of the medical costs for headinjuries associated with motorcycle or moped crashes (Hawai‘iHealth Information Corporation, 2008).  
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardEstablish a working group comprised of traffic safety 
advocates to work on helmet legislation.  
/UIforwardEnhance awareness among decision makers and the publicabout the benefits of motorcycle and moped helmet laws.
Develop and disseminate messages to key decision 
makers and the public that emphasize the effects of helmet laws on health care costs. 
Partner with trauma centers to publicize how helmets 
can prevent traumatic brain injuries and reduce healthcare costs.  
/UIforwardContinue to provide data to traffic safety partners to highlightthe effectiveness of helmets and their cost saving benefits.
Impaired Driving
Recommendation 1: Reduce impaired driving by increasing
the use of screening and brief interventions in hospitals and
primary health centers across the state
Driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs is commonin fatal crashes nationally, and especially in Hawai‘i.  Comparedto other states, Hawai‘i has a higher proportion of fatal crashesthat involve impaired driving (NHTSA, 2012). 
Impairment from alcohol or drugs is represented in all types of
traffic related injuries as well as non-traffic related injuries. It isimportant to address penalties and sanctions to deter impairedPARTNERS

driving and also create opportunities within the medical system to direct high-risk substance users to
methods of reducing substance misuse or treatment.  Con sistent and swift penalties serve as a deterrent,
and access to t reatment helps reduce future incidents.
Research has shown that screening and brief interventions can reduce recidivism of alcohol-related
trauma by up to 50%, which can help reduce DUI arrests and health care costs (Dill, et al., 2004).Screening and brief interventions are practices that help to identify a real or potential alcohol problemand motivate an individual to do something about it.  According to NHTSA’s 2011 report, 
Counter-
measures that Work: A Highway Safety Countermeasure Guide for State Highway Safety Offices , 
the use of screening and brief interventions is a best practice strategy for reducing and preventing impaired driving.  
Recommended Next Steps

Occupant Protection
Recommendation 1: Increase restraint use by supporting a universal safety belt law for all 
vehicle passengers
The safety belt law in Hawai‘i  does not require a seat belt to be worn by passengers over the age of 17 whoare riding in the back seat. A comprehensive safety belt law would cover all seating positions equippedwith a seat belt, in all passenger vehicles.  Between 2006-2009, nearly 75% of unrestrained passengersinvolved in fatal crashes were unbelted in the back seat of a motor vehicle (NHTSA, 2012).
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardRaise public awareness about injuries and fatalities among unbelted passengers in the back 
seats of vehicles.
/UIforwardEducate key decision makers about the benefits of a universal safety belt law.
/UIforwardContinue to provide data and technical assistance to traffic safety partners about seat belt usage. 39 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety
Recommendation 2: Increase promotion of “high visibility enforcement efforts” for all traffic 
safety laws  
Effective, high-visibility communications and outreach are essential components of successful safety beltlaw enforcement programs (Solomon, et al., 2003).  According to NHTSA, strong advertising around the“Click It or Ticket” campaign has been shown to increase safety belt use by 8.6% (Solomon, et al., 2002). 
IPCS maintains a database of traffic safety partners, including programs within the Department of
Health, county fire departments, county police departments, and local hospitals. During the annual“Click It or Ticket” campaign, IPCS disseminates materials provided by the Hawai‘i Department ofTransportation to partners who have expressed an interest and willingness to participate.  The same dissemination methods could be used to promote other national traffic campaigns aimed at reducing impaired or distracted driving. 
Recommended Next Steps 
/UIforwardMaintain and continuously update IPCS’s partnership database.
/UIforwardSeek new partners to help promote national traffic safety campaigns.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety
Recommendation 1: Decrease pedestrian and bicycle-related injuries and fatalities by supporting
“complete streets” policies in each county
“Instituting a complete streets policy ensures that transportation planners and engineers consistently 
design and operate the entire roadway with all users in mind - including bicyclists, public transportation
vehicles and riders, and pedestrians of all ages and abilities.”  (National Complete Streets Coalition)
Since 2005, there has been an increased effort among traffic safety partners and advocates to reduce 
bicycle-related injuries and fatalities.  In conjunction with engineering improvements, improved
planning and design policies, targeted enforcement and public education efforts, and reductions in theaverage number of vehicle miles traveled, bicycle-related deaths in 2009 were nearly half of what theywere in 2005 (NHTSA, 2012). 
In 2009, the Hawai‘i State Legislature passed Act 54 to support complete streets.  Act 54 requires the 
Department of Transportation and county transportation departments to adopt a complete streets policywhen planning future transportation projects.   
Currently, Hawai‘i still has the highest pedestrian fatality rate in the nation for older adults, and 
16 out of 17 bicycle fatalities over the past 5 years involved a motor vehicle. Implementing completestreets design policies and Safe  Routes to School programs will encourage infrastructural, behavioral,
and educational changes to improve the safety and transportation equity for all road users.  40 Injury Specific RecommendationsTraffic Safety
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardProvide pedestrian and bicycle injury data to traffic safety partners to support implementation 
of complete streets policies and Safe Routes to School programs in each county.  
/UIforwardSupport complete streets training and continuing education opportunities for engineers, planners, transportation agency heads and elected officials.
Injury Data for Motor vehicle crashes, occupants (excluding motorcyclists)
Fatal injuries
This category was the 4th leading cause of fatal injuries to Hawai‘i residents, averaging 58 deaths per
year.  About one-third (32%) of the victims were 15 to 24 years of age.  Most (73%) of the victims weremales.  Fatality rates were si gnificantly higher among Neighbor Island residents, compared to O‘ ahu
residents.  The rates for residents of Hawai‘i and Kaua‘i counties were particularly high, more than 4times higher than that computed for Honolulu County.  
More than half (57%) of the fatal crashes occurred during nighttime hours (7:29 p.m. to 5:31 a.m.), and
61% involved only a single vehicle.  Lack of restraint use was a major risk factor for occupant fatalities,as less than half of the victims (47%) were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.  Restraint use wasespecially low among back seat pass engers (25%).  Speeding was the m ost common contributing factor,
noted for 41% of the drivers.  Substance use was also an important contributing factor, as 40% of thedrivers involved in fatal car crashes tested positive for alcohol, almost one-quarter (23%) tested positive for drugs, and nearly half (49%) tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  The peak age of alcohol use among drivers was 21 to 24 years of age, as 56% tested positive for alcohol.  More thanhalf (56%) of the fatalities from car crashes were related to alcohol consumption by at least one driver involved in the crash.Trend: decreasing

Nonfatal injuries
There were more than 4000 nonfatal injuries among car occupants each year in Hawai‘i, with a 
decreasing annual trend.  Most (91%) of the injuries were treated in EDs (emergency departments).Patient age was widely distributed, although 27% were 15 to 24 years of age, and this age group alsohad by far the highest rate of injury.  There were nearly equal numbers of female (52%) and male(48%) patients.  
The nonfatal injury rate for residents of Hawai‘i County was significantly higher than the rate for
residents of any other county, while the rate for Honolulu County residents was significantly lowerthan that for residents of any other county.  Almost all (95%) of the injuries were coded as “traffic”, or occurring on public roads.  Patients were hospitalized for an average of nearly 1 week, with nearly$46,000 in average medical charges per patient.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
Most (86%) of the injured occupants treated by EMS were wearing seatbelts.  Restraint use wasstrongly associated with EMS patient disposition, including a 7-fold increase in mortality rateamong unrestrained occupants (4.5%) compared to those who wore seatbelts (0.6%).  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 10% of the patients, and drinkers were significantly less likely to use seatbelts (71%, vs. 88% for other occupants).  Linked data from 2007 showed unrestrained EMS patients had more than twice (2.3) the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, compared to restrained occupants, and more than triple (3.2) the odds of a fatal injury.  These excess risks were statistically independent of patient age, gender, or the county of the crash.
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
About one-third of the injured resident occupants in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry tested positive for 
alcohol (32%) or illicit drugs (35%).  Considered together, more than half (52%, or 626) of the occupantstested positive for either al cohol or drugs.  Occupants who were drinking were significantly younger
than those who tested negative for al cohol (32 vs. 41 years, on average), more likely to be male (75% vs.
56%), and less likely to have used seat belts (46% vs. 63%).  Trend: decreasing

Injury Data for Motor vehicle crashes, motorcyclists
Fatal injuries
Deaths among motorcyclists were the 6th leading cause of fatal unintentional injuries in the state, 
accounting for 146 total deaths from 2007 to 2011 .  Nearly half (45%) of the victims were adult males
20 to 40 years of age.  Most (73%) of the decedents were riding motorcycles; there were also 27 mopedriders who were killed, including 16 over the 2010 to 2011 period.  The 5-year fatality rates were significantly higher for residents of Hawai‘i and Maui counties compared to Honolulu County. 
Almost half (46%) of the fatal crashes did not involve another vehicle, although that proportion was
lower (26%) among the fatally injured moped riders.  Only about one-fourth (27%) of all riders werewearing a helmet at the time of the crash, including only 7% of the moped riders.  Nearly half (47%) of the decedents tested positive for alcohol, and 29% for illicit drugs.  Alcohol use was most commonamong drivers who crashed during nighttime (66%) and among those in crashes without another motorvehicle (69%).  About half (51%) of the fatally injured drivers did not have a valid motorcyclist license,and that proportion was significantly higher among those who had consumed alcohol (58%, vs. 44%among other drivers).  More than one-half (58%) of the riders were noted to have been speeding atthe time of the crash, a proportion that was higher among motorcyclists (62%) and those who crashedon O‘ ahu (66%).

Nonfatal injuries
There was a decreasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among motorcyclists over the
2007 to 2010 period, but an increase in 2011 .  More than 1000 were treated in EDs each year and another 276 were hospitalized.  Patient age was narrowly distributed, with 51% between 15 and 34 yearsof age.  The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was among 20 to 24 year olds.Most (83%) of the patients were males.  
Although about half (54%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County, residents there had 
significantly lower rates of nonfatal injuries than residents of any other county.  Injury rates were 
approximately twice as high among residents of Neighbor Islands.  Forty-four percent of the crashes did not involve a collision, but were due to loss of control by the rider.  Three-fourths (75%) of the nonfatal injuries were coded as “traffic” related, or  occurring on a public roadway, while 25% were in
“non-traffic” environments, including off-road crashe s.  Nearly one-fifth (19%)  of the patients who 
were injured in non-traffic crashes were 5 to 14 years of age.  The average hospitalization was nearly 
1 week in duration and resulted in over $51 ,000 in medical charges.  About two-thirds (64%) of thehospitalized patients and one-quarter (23%) of those treated in EDs had fractures.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
About 55% of the EMS Patients were riding motorcycles (55%), and 40% were riding mopeds (status unknown for 5%). 
About two-thirds (65%) of all riders were wearing a helmet.  The proportion not 
wearing helmets was significantly higher, nearly doubled, among the moped riders (68%), compared to motorcycle riders (38%).  Patient condition differed by helmet usage, as helmeted riders were significantly more likely to be transported with minor or moderate injuries (23%, co mpared to 19% for
unhlemeted riders), and significantly less likely to be transported in critical condition (1 .9% vs. 3.7%).The mortality rate among helmeted riders (2.5%, or 31 of 1249) was also significantly less than thatamong unhelmeted riders (4.6%, or 86 of 1879).  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 12% of the patients, and alcohol users were significantly less likely to have worn helmets (14%, vs 41% amongthose with no alcohol use).
Linked data from 2007 showed the odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or 
resulted in death were 40% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, and the former also had more than twice the odds (2.2) of a fatal injury.  The protective effects of helmet usewere magnified if only motorcycle ri ders were considered.  Unhelmeted m otorcycle riders had twice 
the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, more than 3 times the odds of a fatal injury, and 3 times the odds of a TBI (traumatic brain injury).Trend: no trend

Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
About one-fourth (26%) of the injured resident motorcycle/moped riders in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry
tested positive for alcohol, including 21% (178) with BAC (blood alcohol content) levels of 0.08 or greater,and 14% (117) with BAC levels of 0. 16% or greater.  Moped riders were significantly more likely thanmotorcyclists to have been drinking (31% vs 24%, respectively).  More than half (54%, or 464) of the riders tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, including most (78%) of the 285 moped riders.  Alcoholusage was 4 times more common among those who crashed during night time (54%) compared to thosewho crashed between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (14%).
Motor vehicle crashes, pedestrians
Fatal injuries
There was no statistically significant trend in the annual number of pedestrian fatalities, although the highest total occurred in 2007 (37 deaths).  Senior-aged residents comprised 47% of the victims, and the fatality rates increased dramatically across the oldest age groups.  Most (69%) of the victims were hit on O‘ ahu, but there were no significant differences in county-specific fatality rates.  Almost all (80%) of the victims who were 65 years or older were hit on O‘ ahu, and the fatality rate for O‘ ahu seniors was statistically comparable to that for seniors living on Neighbor Islands (36 vs. 22 deaths/100,000, respectively).    
There were 2 peak times for pedestrian fatalities: 27 crashes (21% of the total) occurred between 5:31 a.m.
and 9:29 a.m., and 40 (31%) took place between 5:31 p.m. and 11:29 p.m.  Only 34% of the victims were ina crosswalk at the time of the crash; a nearly equal proportion (35%) were hit on open stretches of roadway.The most common speed zone was 25 miles per hour (45% of crashes).  Almost two-thirds than half(63%) of the senior-aged victims were hit in 25 mph or slower zones, compared to 33% of pedestriansunder the age of 65 years.  According to FARS data from 2007 to 2010, more than one-quarter (26%) of the 84 fatally injured pedestrians tested positive for alcohol, and 25% had BAC levels of 0.08% orhigher. Alcohol use was significantly higher amo ng male victims (42%) compared to females (6%).  The
highest prevalence of alcohol use was seen among victims in the 21 to 34 year age group (70%, or 7 of 10),and the 35 to 54 year age group (52%, or 11 of 21).  According to FARS data, 39% (33) of the pedestrianvictims were in the roadway erroneously, most commonly by “improper crossing of roadway or intersection”, including jaywalking (21%, or 18 victims).  Including the victims who tested positive for alcohol or drugs, 54% (or 45) of the pedestrians made an error that contributed to the crash.  More
than half (59%, or 52) of the 88 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash.  Most commonly,they were described as “inattentive” (38%), failed to yield the right of way (25%), or were speeding (18%).  Trend: no trend

Nonfatal injuries
The annual number of nonfatal injuries to pedestrians generally decreased from 649 in 2007 to 583 in
2011 .  About one-quarter (23%) of the patients with nonfatal injuries were admitted to hospitals, thehighest such proportion for any unintentional injury category.  Patient age was widely distributed, butone-third (33%) were in the 5 to 24 year age group.  This group also had the highest rate of nonfatal injuries that were treated in E Ds, while senior aged residents had the highest rates of hospitalizations.
The rates of both ED visits and all injuries (ED visits combined with hospitalizations) were lowest for
Maui County residents, although all county-specific rates were statistically comparable.  Most (88%) ofthe nonfatal injuries were coded as  “traffic” related, or occurring on a public roadway, while 12% were in
“non-traffic” environments, including private roads, driveways and parking lots.  Thirty percent ofthe patients injured in non-traffic crashes were in the 1 to 14 year age group.  Patients were hospitalizedfor an average of 9 days, with nearly $60,000 in medic al charges.  Hospitalization s accounted for most
(73%) of total patient days and 87% of the $9.4 million in total medical charges.  
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
There were 2 peak periods for the time of the EMS-attended crashes, from 6:31 a.m. to 8:29 a.m. (13%,or 287 crashes), and from 2:29 p.m. to 7:29 p.m. (35%, or 788 crashes).  The time distribution differedby patient age, as crashes with senior-aged pedestrians were more likely to occur during daytime hours(86%), compared to crashes involving pedestrians under 65 years of age (73%).  Patient condition differedby age, as senior-aged pedestrians were significantly more likely to be transported to a hospital, comparedto pedestrians under 65 years of age (85% vs. 79%, respectively), and had a significantly higher mortality
rate (10.3%, or 47 of 456, vs. 3.6%, or 67 of 1855).  The mortality rate was also significantly elevatedamong pedestrians who were hit during night time hours (7.4%, or 42 of 566), compared to those hitbetween 5:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (4. 1%, or 72 of 1747), despite the younger age d istribution among the
former.  Probable al cohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.  Patients who had used alcohol

Injury Data for Motor Vehicle Crashes, Bicyclists
Fatal injuries
There were between 2 and 4 bicyclists killed in Hawai‘i each year, and 80% (12) of the 15 deaths occurredon O‘ ahu.  There was no apparent high-risk age group.  Almost all (87%, or 13) of the bicyclists killedover the 5-year period were males.  Most (87%, or 13) of the victims were hit by a car; 2 others died afterfalling off their bicycles.  Only 2 of the victims were wearing helmets at the time of the crash (statusunknown for 2 others).  There was no notable peak time of the day for the crashes; most (64%, or 9)occurred between during daylight hours between 7:31 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.  
Almost all (91%, or 10) of the 11 traffic-related crashes (from 2007 to 2010) involved cars traveling
straight on the road; only 1 crash was due to a car making a turn.  Two (18%) of the 11 bicyclists testedpositive for alcohol, and 4 (36%) tested positive for drugs.  Overall, about half (54%, or 6) of the victimstested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Besides substance use 2 bicyclists were traveling against  traffic at the time of the crash and another failed to yield the right-of -way.  Four (36%) of the 11 drivers
made an error which contributed to the crash, most commonly substance use and speeding (2 instances each).  
Nonfatal injuries
There were more than 1200 nonfatal injuries to bicyclists each year, with a generally increasing trend.
Most (92%) of the injuries were treated in EDs (emergency departments).  Males comprised 75% of thepatients, including 80% of those who were hospitalized.  Nearly one-third (31%) of the patients were 5 to14 years of age, and the injury rate for 5 to 14 year-olds (244 injuries/100,000 residents) were more than3 times higher than the rate for residents of other ages (74/100,000).

The injury rate for Kaua‘i County residents was significantly higher than the rates for any other county,
and approximately double the rate estimates for residents of Honolulu or Maui counties.  Almost all(85%) of the injuries were coded as “non-traffic”, or occurring on private roads, driveways, or off-roadenvironments.  Most of the injuri es treated in EDs (88%) and re quiring hospitalization (71%) were coded to
indicate crashes that did not involve a collision w ith another vehicle or object, but were probably due to
the patient falling off of the bicycle.  Although 92% of the patients were treated in EDs, hospitalizationscomprised 32% of the treatment days and 66% of the total medical charges of $5.8 million/year.  Most(63%) of the hospitalized patients had fractures, including 15% with skull fra ctures and 20% with leg
fractures.  More than one-third (38%) of these patients had a traumatic brain injury.
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
Most (73%) of the EMS-attended bicyclist crashes were distributed over the 11-hour period of 7:31 a.m. to6:29 p.m., with a peak from 4:31 p.m. to 6:29 p.m. (17%).  About half (53%) of the injuries involved motorvehicles and 47% did not.  Only 27% of the injured bicyclists wore helmets.  Unhelmeted riders had asignificantly higher proportion of “ critical” or fatal injuries (2. 1%, or 22 of 1031), compared to helmetedriders (0.7%, or 3 of 458).  These differences were acc entuated among crashes that involved motor vehicles,
as the proportion of unhelmeted bicyclists with critical or fatal injuries was 3. 1% (17 of 540), compared to0.9% (2 of 214) among helmeted riders.  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.If only the bicyclists with known alcohol and helmet status were considered, helmet use was 5 timeshigher among those who did not consume alcohol (35%), compared to the drinkers (5%).  
Linked data from 2007 showed odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death were 80% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, although this estimatewas only of “borderline” statistical significance (p=0. 11).

Only 11% of the injured bicyclists in the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry had been drinking at the time they
were injured.  T his percentage was nearly three times higher among those hurt in crashes that did not
involve a motor vehicle compared to those who were hit by motor vehicles (15% vs. 6%, respectively).About one-quarter of the bicyclists tested positive for illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (17%),and this proportion did not differ by the type of crash.  Overall, one-third (33%, or 89) of the 271 patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  None of the 28 bicyclists who had been drinking werewearing a helmet at the time of the crash, compared to 27% usage among those who tested negative for alcohol, and 31% among those who were not tested.

Background and Accomplishments
The Hawai‘i State Department of Health, Maternal and Child Health Branch (MCHB) leads activities 
in the state to prevent intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and child maltreatment, with supportfrom the Injury Prevention and Control Section (IPCS) and other partners in the community.  IPCS hasbeen specifically involved with bullying prevention and also leads activities in the state to prevent suicide prevention.
/UIforwardBeginning in 2009, IPCS and community partners worked with MCHB to identify Title V bullying
prevention and child abuse and neglect prevention performance measures.  With technical support from the national Children’s Safety Network, MCHB and IPCS collaborated to conduct the first statewide cross-program int egration training in November 2009 for bullying and child
abuse and neglect prevention. The training strengthened collaborative efforts between IPCS, MCHB,and community partners on program and policy initiatives related to violence prevention.
/UIforwardThe Safe Schools Community Advisory Committee developed 33 recommendations for policies andstrategies to address bullying and harassment in public schools.  Members are currently working toget these recommendations adopted by the Board of Education and Department of Education.
/UIforwardThe Maui County Ho‘ oikaika Partnership is a group of agencies working together since 2008 toimplement best practices and policies as they strengthen violence prevention services for childrenand their caregivers. This collaborative initiative serveS as a model for similar partnerships acrossthe state.
/UIforwardThe Asian/Pacific Islander Youth Violence Prevention Center was established in 2000 as one of tenNational Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention funded by CDC.  Sincethen, the Center has partnered with IPCS and other organizations to conduct research on youth 
violence and develop, implement and evaluate violence prevention programs.
/UIforwardIPCS helped establish a non-profit coalition to promote primary prevention of violence, Prevent Violence H awai‘i.  IPCS funded the University of Hawai‘i Social Science Research Institute 
to produce, Ending Violence: A 2004 Status Report on Violence Prevention in Hawai‘i.  The report’s
recommendations were based on the World Health Organization’s approach to addressing riskfactors and solutions common to all areas of violence.  Concerns about sustaining efforts in individualareas of violence hampered the organization’s ability to take a unified approach to violence prevention, and the non-profit dissolved in 2010.
Recommendations
In 2010, a statewide needs assessment was conducted that included an online survey of 149 people 
representing government agencies, law enforcement, schools and universities, medical centers, non-profit organizations, private businesses, and grassroots organizations; and qualitative interviews with 21 key informants from state agencies and universities.  A cross-disciplinary stakeholder group was convened to review the results and recommendations, and assess whether they reflected the potential for measurable progress and impact over the next five years. 
The resulting recommendations outlined here build on Ending Violence: A 2004 Status Report on 
Violence Prevention in Hawai‘i and the Hawai‘i Injury Prevention Plan 2005-2010.  They reflectstakeholders’ renewed readiness to collaborate. Effectively preventing violence will take the concerted efforts of individuals and organizations from all sectors working together across all areas of violence.49 Injury Specific RecommendationsViolence and Abuse Prevention
Recommendation 1: Establish and promote forums for collaboration and information sharing to help
integrate violence and abuse prevention efforts statewide 
While different types of violence share common risk factors and prevention strategies, prevention efforts are often independent. Forums that encourage organizations that serve different populations and address different types of violence to share information about effective strategies would facilitatecollaboration and coordination of efforts (Saul, et al, 2008). 
Efforts should be comprehensive and address the different types of violence, encourage the use of 
evidence-based program and policy practices, and account for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention as appropriate.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardFacilitate opportunities for inter-agency collaboration and coordination among organizations 
serving different populations and addressing various sub-forms of violence.
/UIforwardExpand the use of new and existing channels of communication such as newsletters, listservs, websites, clearinghouses, and other means of technology to facilitate the exchange of informationand resources among partners at all levels and in all areas of violence.
Recommendation 2: Collaborate with professionals and community workers to develop a public
awareness campaign about violence and abuse prevention.
Current partners represent all levels of prevention and include community and non-profit socialservice organizations, primary health care centers, law enforcement, and selected policymakers. But there are additional partners who may not be aware of their potential role in violence prevention or understand the value of their programs to violence prevention efforts.
Engaging partners in the development, implementation and evaluation of a communications campaign
to raise public awareness will increase likelihood of success at all levels (e.g., developing messages, producing materials, identifying appropriate channels for dissemination).

/UIforwardPartner with representatives from the media to enhance efforts and increase reach for messaging.
Recommendation 3: Promote training that enhances knowledge and skills of community workers
and professionals working in violence prevention and related fields
There should be continued training among providers and organizations, and audiences should extendbeyond those working directly in the violence and abuse prevention fields.  For example, teachers andcounselors could receive related information as part of their academic training.  Organizations couldadopt violence prevention modules as part of their new employee orientation protocols.
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardIdentify training opportunities and resources available to community workers in the violence and
abuse prevention fields to enhance their knowledge and skills in primary prevention.
/UIforwardIdentify training opportunities and resources for other professionals and community members toenhance their knowledge and skills in primary prevention.
Recommendation 4: Enhance the use of data to understand common risk and protective factors 
for violence prevention
Data are crucial to understanding the complex issue of violence.  Data help programs develop priorities,guide interventions and policies, and mobilize support (World Health Organization, 2002).  Barriers tocollecting and sharing information across agencies need to be removed so that data are accessible toeveryone.  There also are additional data sources (i.e., on different types of violence) that would help illustrate trends and better guide research and intervention efforts.  
Recommended Next Steps
/UIforwardFacilitate data and information sharing across state agencies.
/UIforwardIdentify and acquire new data sources to develop an annual report on child maltreatment that will
enhance understanding of violence and abuse.51 Injury Specific RecommendationsViolence and Abuse Prevention
Injury Data for Homicides and Assaults
Fatal injuries
There were 112 victims of homicide over the 5-year period, with a decreasing trend from 29 in 2008 to 
17 in 2011 .   More than half (58%) of the victims were in the 25 to 54 year age range, but there were also 6 victims (5%) who were u nder 5 years of age.  Males comprised 59% of the victims.  The fatality rate
for residents of O‘ ahu (8.8 deaths/100, 000 residents) was statistically comparable to the rate for all
Neighbor Island residents (8.4/100,000).  
The most common method was the use of firearms (35%), followed by stabbings (28%), and physical
force or unarmed beatings (25%).  According to Uniform Crime Reports from 2007 to 2009, most (73%)of the homicide victims knew their assailant, and only a minority (19%) were killed by strangers.  Femalevictims were most likely to be killed by their intimate partner (37%, vs. 5% of male victims), while maleswere most likely to be killed by extra-familial acquaintances (40%) or strangers (25%).
Nonfatal injuries
There were over 4200 nonfatal injuries from assaults among Hawai‘i residents each year, with noclear trend over time.  Males comprised two-thirds (67%) of the patients treated in EDs (emergencydepartments) and an even greater proportion (89%) of those who were hospitalized.  More than half(58%) of the patients were 15 to 34 years of age; few (5%) were under 15 years of age, or over 65 yearsof age (1%).  The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was the 15 to 29 year agegroup, particularly 20 to 24 year-olds.  Trend: decreasing trend

hosp.(7%)52 Injury Specific RecommendationsThe injury rate for residents of Hawai‘i County was significantly higher than for any other county, while
the rate for residents of Honolulu County was significantly lower than any other county.  Patients werehospitalized for nearly 5 days on average, with over $31 ,000 in charges for each admission.  Unarmedbeatings caused 70% of all injuries, and 61% of those that required hospitalization.  Fractures were themost common type of injury (53%) that required hospitalization, including 44% of patients admittedwith a skull fracture.
EMS data
The number of EMS-attended incidents generally increased over the course of the day (starting at 6 a.m.),reaching a broad peak during the 7:31 p.m. to 2:29 a.m. period (48% of the total).  The home or residenceof the patient was the most common location for the assault (40%), followed by other indoor location orbuildings (17%), most commonly “public buildings” (7%), and bars and restaurants (6%).  One-fifth (20%)of the patients were transported in serious or critical condition.  That proportion was highest among thesenior-aged victims (29%).  Probable alcohol use was noted for 29% of the patients.  Patients who had consumed alcohol were significantly less likely to be released at the scene (34%, vs. 52% for other patients),and twice as likely to be transported in serious condition (31% vs. 15%, respectively).    
Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
Nearly half (46%) of the adult-aged (18 years and older) Hawai‘i Trauma Registry resident patients
who were i njured by assaults were p ositive for alcohol, and more than one-third (38%) tested positive for
illicit drugs.  About three-fourths (76%, or 286) of the 375 drinkers had BAC (blood alcohol content)levels of 0.08% or greater.  THC (marijuana) was the most commonly documented drug (19% of thepatients), followed by amphetamines (15%) and narcotics (15%).  Considered together, about two-thirds(67%) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol use was significantly morelikely among the male patients (49%) compared to females (27%), among those injured on weekends(54% vs. 41% for those assaulted on weekdays), and among those assaulted during night time hours(54%, vs. 30% for those injured between 6:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m.).Violence and Abuse Prevention53 AppendicesRECOMMENDATIONS STATUS* CURRENT COMMENTS

among residents of Hawai‘i.  This is consistent with national reporting conventions of injury mortalityand allows for the comparison of fat al injury rates in Hawai‘i with rates for the remainder of the country.
Also, other population estimates (e.g. age, ethnicity, county, etc.) were available only for residents, sothe inclusion of injuries among non-residents would result in an over-estimation of injury rates.  Theexclusion of non-residents reduces the amount of fatal injuries by about 9%, hospitalizations by 9%, andemergency department visits by 9%.  (Non-residents compr ised 47% of the drowning victims in Hawai‘i,
so they are included in some of the data in the drowning section.)
The calculation of injury mortality rates necessitates the definition of “ at risk” populations for 
the denominator.  This data was obtained from the web site for the U.S. Census Bureau (2012).  Rate estimates used the average annual population estimate over the 2007 to 2010, since 2011 estimates were not available when preparation of this report began.  
The primary source of injury mortality data in Hawai‘i is the death certificate database of the Hawai‘i
Department of Health.  The ICD-10 underlying cause of death codes were grouped as recommended bythe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with some exceptions (CDC, 2002).  For some types ofinjuries, the open text information on how the injury occurred was reviewed to extract information notcaptured by the cause of death code.  Supplemental data was also used for certain injury categories.Data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was linked to death certificate data for deaths from traffic crashes(NHTSA, n.d.).  Supplemental data on homicides was abstracted from the Uniform Crime Reports(UCR), maintained by the National Archive of Criminal Justice data (2010).  The autopsy records of O‘ ahu suicide and drowning victims were also reviewed for the 2007 to 2010 period.  
The main source of data on nonfatal injuries was the Hawai‘i Health Information Corporation (HHIC),
which receives abstracted data from the medical records of patients treated in all hospital-basedemergency departments (EDs) and hospitals in the state, with the exception of  ED records from TriplerArmy Medical Center.  A record was defined as injury-related if the principle diagnosis was within theICD-9CM series 800-995.85, with the following exclusions: 909.3, 909.5, 995.0-995.4, 995.6-995.7(Injury Surveillance Workgroup, 2003).  Patients who died in the hospitals or who were discharged tohospice facilities were excluded from these analyses.  To prevent double-counting of injuries, patientswho were transferred to another hospital at discharge were excluded.  Injuries resulting from “ adverse effects”, as indicated by external cause of injury codes (E-codes) were also excluded (CDC, 2007).
E-codes were used to group nonfatal injuries into mechanisms that corresponded to the groupings for
fatal injuries (CDC, 2007).  In this report, all nonfatal self-inflicted injuries are described as “suicide attempts”, although this is not actually discernible through E-codes.  This may have resulted in an overestimation of suicide attempts, but it is also possible that self-inflicted injuries in generalare underreported.  
It is important to note that the extent of E-coding varied across the counties patients reside in, and over
time within those counties.  The records for residents of Neighbor Islands were significantly more likelyto have E-codes than records for residents of Honolulu County (on average 97.4% vs. 87.5%, respectively).There were also decreasing trends in the proportion of inpatient records with E-codes for all countiesexcept Maui, although these were most meaningful for O‘ ahu hospitals.  These variations in E-coding needto be considered when interpreting comparisons between counties and examining trends within a countyAppendix B: Data Sources and Methods59 Appendicesover time.  Most statistics in this report are based only on E-coded records, and therefore underestimate
the real magnitude of injuries by about 9% for both those treated at EDs and for those injuries requiringhospitalizations.  There was some inconsistency in the contribution to the HHIC database from certainindividual hospitals.  One O‘ ahu hospital began contributing ED records in November, 2008, althoughthis hospital accounted for only 1 .4% of ED records.  Two other O‘ ahu hospitals closed operations in mid-December of 2011 .  
EMS data is included in certain chapters (motor vehicle crashes, falls and assaults) for which there were
discreet injury codes in the EMS data collection system.  EMS personnel document the use of protectiveequipment (seat belts and helmets) and the approximate time and location of the injury, elements whichare lacking from the more population-based HHIC data.  Patient use of alcohol and drugs is also noted in EMS data, either by patient admission, the smell of alcohol on the breath, or physical evidence (e.g.bottles, drug paraphernalia, etc.) at the scene.  However, since use of “ drugs” is not specific, only the EMScharacterization of patient alcohol use is examined.  To avoid double-counting of individual patients,those who were transferred to another EMS unit were excluded from analyses.  Patients who refusedtransport to hospitals (or released at the scene) and those who were dead upon EMS arrival or who diedwhile in EMS care were included, however, to provide a full description of the effects of protective factorsor alcohol use.  
A grant from the Hawai‘i Department of Transportation (DOT) enabled the linkage of 2007 EMS records
related to motor vehicle crashes to DOT, HHIC, and FARS, and death certificate records.  EMS recordswere linked to DOT, FARS and death certificate records probabilistically, on the basis of time, date, andlocation of the crash, and patient age, gender and seating position.  This product was then linked toHHIC records by deterministic methods using patient identifiers, including name and date of birth.This linked dataset provided examination of the effect of protective devices (as described by EMS, DOTand FARS) with the ultimate medical disposition of the patients (as described by HHIC records anddeath certificates).  
More complete and test-based results of toxicology were available from the Hawai‘i Trauma Registry (HTR).
The HTR includes data from the 7 main trauma centers in the state.  Data was available for the 2008 to2011 period, but 6 of the trauma centers did not begin contributing data until 2009.  HTR data was included to provide a description of substance use among patients who had nonfatal (although serious)injuries from a variety of mechanisms.  To avoid double-counting, the results of HTR patients who weretransferred at discharge were excluded.  Patients who died, either in the ED or after hospitalization, were included, to examine associations between substance use and mortality for injuries where these relationships are not better described through other data systems (e.g. motor vehicle deaths and FARS).  
Most of the injury rates have been standardized for age distribution, by the direct method, using the 
U.S. 2000 standard population (Anderson & Rosenberg, 1998).  Sixteen age groups were used for standardization across all ages, although certain calculations were restricted to more narrow age ranges.Statistical tests were conducted with t-tests for continuously distributed variables (e.g. patient age) andchi-squared tests for categorical variables (e.g. patient gender).  Some trends (described as “significant”or “non-significant”) were formally assessed using Poisson regression (Clayton & Hills, 1993).  Rate differences were tested using different techniques, depending on sample size and use of age standardiza-tion (Dever, 1984).  All statistical significance testing was conducted at the 95% confidence level.  Appendix B: Data Sources and Methods60 AppendicesADRC – Adult Disability Resources Centers

The Spectrum of Prevention is a broad framework that outlines seven levels of intervention, or strategies,
intended to address complex public health problems.  These strategies account for the various factorsthat contribute to community health and safety and can be used to develop a comprehensive approachto address public health concerns. 
Influencing Policy and Legislation
Legislation and policy initiatives affect large numbers of people by improving their environments, encouraging healthy lifestyles, and providing for consumer protections.
Mobilizing Neighborhoods and Communities
Engaging neighborhoods and communities in the process of identifying, prioritizing and addressingpublic health concerns leads to more accepted and successful community interventions. 
Changing Organizational Practices
Modifying internal policies and practices of agencies and organizations can lead to improved healthand safety for staff and clients and contribute to a healthier community.  Changing practices in someagencies (e.g., law enforcement, schools) may also affect community health.
Fostering Coalitions and Networks
Coalitions and networks that represent local government, public health, private and nonprofitorganizations, health care, and the community provide an opportunity for collaborative planning, coordinated use of resources, and strong support of legislation and organizational change. 
Educating Providers
Educated providers, in and out of the health field, play an important role by identifying injury preventionissues and intervening as needed. Providers may encourage adoption of injury prevention behaviors, offereducation, and advocate for legislation and organizational change. 
Promoting Community Education
Community education uses different communication channels to reach as many people as possible withhealth education messages.  These messages aim to change behaviors and build a critical mass of peoplewho will become engaged in the issue. 
Strengthening Individual Knowledge and Skills
Health educators and trained community members work directly with individuals to promote health andsafety. Attention may be given to building individuals’ capacity to use new approaches, educate others,or become more engaged in advocacy.

1The Hawaii State Department of Health is pleased to present “Injuries in Hawaii: 2007-2011”. 
This report contains the latest findings on the leading causes of injury mortality and morbidity in Hawaii . 
Injuries are a major public health problem in Hawaii. They are by far the leading cause of 
death among children and young adults, and the fourth leading cause of death among state residents of all ages. Over the 5-year period covered in this report, a total of 3,355 residents died from their injuries.
The information in this report is for health and safety professionals, policy makers, and for 
everyone interested in protecting and improving the health of the people of Hawaii. The report includes descriptions of the geography and magnitude of the problem, trends, and populations at higher risk, and provides insight into some of the circumstances of these injury fatalities. It is crucial that good data be available to guide prevention and policy efforts to reduce injuries in Hawaii. This report is a first step. Please join the Department of Health, state and local agencies, and community organizations in working toward a safer Hawaii. 
Additional copies of this report and other injury prevention information may be obtained by 
calling the Department’ s Injury Prevention and Control Section at 808-733-9320. 
Loretta J. Fuddy, ACSW, MPH
Director of HealthHawai‘i State Department of HealthIntroductionIntroduction
2 What is the leading cause of death among Hawaii’s children and young adults? The answer is 
not infectious disease or chronic diseases, such as cancer, but a public health problem that is chiefly 
non-medical in nature: injuries. The field of “injury” includes a diversity of events, ranging from unintentional motor vehicle crashes, drownings, falls, and poisonings, to assaults and suicides. Injuries currently account for more deaths among Hawaii residents aged 1 to 39 years than all other diseases combined. Injuries are also a leading cause of mortality in later ages, and for some outcomes (e.g. suicides) the highest risks are seen in the elderly. 
There are risk factors for injuries, just as there are for certain diseases. To a large degree, many injuries 
can be prevented by reducing these risk factors, either to prevent the original cause (e.g. observing posted speed limits to prevent a crash) or the severity of the injury (e.g. utilizing seat belts). Injury risk factors generally take two forms: risks imposed by the physical environment in which the injury takes place, and perhaps more commonly, individual behaviors which place a person at risk. This report describes fatal injuries in Hawaii over the 2007-2011 period, with an emphasis on the environmental and individual risk factors involved. This includes the geographic mapping of fatal injuries, and the analysis of the demography and behaviors of the victims. For many types of fatal injuries, this involved linking the basic information contained on death certificates to more detailed information from crash reports, autopsy records, and criminal investigations. Nonfatal injuries over the 2007-2010 period are also described in this report. These far outnumber fatal injuries and in many respects impose a greater public health burden. 
Although this report provides perhaps the most detailed summary of injuries currently available in 
the state, it was not intended to be completely comprehensive. Readers who are interested in further information on a given area are encouraged to contact the Injury Prevention and Control Section. This report is intended to bring attention to the problem of injuries, and to help inform and direct efforts to prevent fatal injuries in Hawaii.
 Executive Summary
3Executive Summary
 Fatal injuries are a major public health problem in Hawaii, constituting the 4th leading cause of death among state 
residents. Injuries are by far the leading cause of mortality among residents aged 1 to 40 years, accounting for more deaths 
in this age group than all other diseases combined. This report describes the magnitude of fatal injuries in the state, examines trends over time, and identifies geographic areas and segments of the population that are at increased risk of fatal injuries. This detailed report is a first step in bringing attention to the problem of fatal injuries, and providing information to design and direct injury prevention programs. 
Although a leading cause of mortality, fatal injuries are relatively less common in Hawaii, compared to the rest of the 
United States. The age-standardized 5-year rate for unintentional injuries was 17% lower in Hawaii, a statistically significant difference. The homicide rate in Hawaii was roughly one-third of that for the rest of the U.S., while the suicide rates were more comparable. 
A total of 3,355 residents were killed by injuries over the 5-year period. Most deaths (2,159, or 64%) were unintentional, 795 
(24%) were suicides, and 112 (3%) were homicides. The intent could not be determined for 283 (8%) deaths. There was no trend in the annual rate of all fatal injuries, but there was a significantly increasing trend in the suicide fatality rate. The rate of deaths from unintentional injuries decreased significantly over the 2007 to 2010 period, but an increase in 2011 resulted in no clear trend over the entire 5-year period. The rate of homicides decreased significantly if only the 2008 to 2011 period was considered. 
 Although of a lesser severity, nonfatal injuries greatly outnumber fatal injuries, and constitute significant medical 
and financial burdens for the residents of Hawaii. For every resident who dies from an injury there are nearly 10 others who are hospitalized for nonfatal injuries, and another 118 who are treated and released from emergency departments (EDs). These ratios translate to 5,980 hospitalizations from nonfatal injuries and nearly 80,000 visits to EDs each year in Hawaii. There was a significantly increasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal injuries treated at hospitals in Hawaii, from 85,675 in 2007 to 87,111 in 2011. 
Unintentional injuries, by main categories
Motor vehicle crashes, occupants (excluding motorcyclists)Fatal injuries
 This category was the 4th leading cause of fatal injuries to Hawaii residents, averaging 58 deaths per year. About 
one-third (32%) of the victims were 15 to 24 years of age. Most (73%) of the victims were males. Fatality rates were significantly higher among Neighbor Island residents, compared to Oahu residents. The rates for residents of Hawaii and Kauai counties were particularly high, more than 4 times higher than that computed for Honolulu County .

4More than half (57%) of the fatal crashes occurred during nighttime hours (7:29 p.m. to 5:31 a.m.), and 61% involved 
only a single vehicle. Lack of restraint use was a major risk factor for occupant fatalities, as less than half of the vic -
tims (47%) were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash. Restraint use was especially low among back seat pas -
sengers (25%). Speeding was the most common contributing factor, noted for 41% of the drivers. Substance use was 
also an important contributing factor, as 40% of the drivers involved in fatal car crashes tested positive for alcohol, almost one-quarter (23%) tested positive for drugs, and nearly half (49%) tested positive for either alcohol or drugs. The peak age of alcohol use among drivers was 21 to 24 years of age, as 56% tested positive for alcohol. More than half 
(56%) of the fatalities from car crashes were related to alcohol consumption by at least one driver involved in the crash.
Nonfatal injuries
 There were more than 4000 nonfatal injuries among car occupants each year in Hawaii, with a decreasing annual 
trend. Most (91%) of the injuries were treated in EDs. Patient age was widely distributed, although 27% were 15 to 24 
years of age, and this age group also had by far the highest rate of injury. There were nearly equal numbers of female (52%) and male (48%) patients.

 The nonfatal injury rate for residents of Hawaii County was significantly higher than the rate for residents of 
any other county, while the rate for Honolulu County residents was significantly lower than that for residents of any other county. Almost all (95%) of the injuries were coded as “traffic”, or occurring on public roads. Patients were hospitalized for an average of nearly 1 week, with nearly $46,000 in average medical char ges per patient. 
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
 Most (86%) of the injured occupants treated by EMS were wearing seatbelts. Restraint use was strongly associated 
with EMS patient disposition, including a 7-fold increase in mortality rate among unrestrained occupants (4.5%) compared to those who wore seatbelts (0.6%). Probable alcohol use was noted for about 10% of the patients, and drinkers were significantly less likely to use seatbelts (71%, vs. 88% for other occupants). Linked data from 2007 showed unrestrained EMS patients had more than twice (2.3) the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, compared to restrained occupants, and more than triple (3.2) the odds of a fatal injury. These excess risks were statistically independent of patient age, gender, or the county of the crash.
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
About one-third of the injured resident occupants in the HTR tested positive for alcohol (32%) or illicit drugs (35%). Considered together, more than half (52%, or 626) of the occupants tested positive for either alcohol or drugs. Occupants who were drinking were significantly younger than those who tested negative for alcohol (32 vs. 41 years, on average), more likely to be male (75% vs. 56%), and less likely to have used seat belts (46% vs. 63%). 667847

5Motor vehicle crashes, motorcyclists
Fatal injuries
 Deaths among motorcyclists were the 6th leading cause of fatal unintentional injuries in the state, accounting for 
146 total deaths from 2007 to 2011. Nearly half (45%) of the victims were adult males 20 to 40 years of age. Most (73%) of the decedents were riding motorcycles; there were also 27 moped riders who were killed, including 16 over the 2010 to 2011 period. The 5-year fatality rates were significantly higher for residents of Hawaii and Maui counties compared to Honolulu County.

 Almost half (46%) of the fatal crashes did not involve another vehicle, although that proportion was lower (26%) 
among the fatally injured moped riders. Only about one-fourth (27%) of all riders were wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, including only 7% of the moped riders. Nearly half (47%) of the decedents tested positive for alcohol, and 29% for illicit drugs. Alcohol use was most common among drivers who crashed during nighttime (66%) and among those in crashes without another motor vehicle (69%). About half (51%) of the fatally injured drivers did not have a valid motorcy-clist license, and that proportion was significantly higher among those who had consumed alcohol (58%, vs. 44% among other drivers). More than one-halt (58%) of the riders were noted to have been speeding at the time of the crash, a propor -
tion that was higher among motorcyclists (62%) and those who crashed on Oahu (66%). 
Nonfatal injuries
 There was an decreasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among motorcyclists over the 2007 to 
2010 period, but an increase in 2011. More than 1000 were treated in EDs each year and another 276 were hospitalized. Patient age was narrowly distributed, with 51% between 15 and 34 years of age. The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was among 20 to 24 year-olds. Most (83%) of the patients were males.

 Although about half (54%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County, residents there had significantly 
lower rates of nonfatal injuries than residents of any other county.   Injury rates were approximately twice as high among residents of Neighbor Islands.  Forty-four percent of the crashes did not involve a collision, but were due to loss of control by the rider.  Three-fourths (75%) of the nonfatal injuries were coded as “traffic” related, or occurring on a public roadway, while 25% were in “non-traffic” environments, including off-road crashes.  Nearly one-fifth (19%) of the patients who were injured in non-traffic crashes were 5 to 14 years of age.  The average hospitalization was nearly 1 week in duration 45

EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
 About 55% of the EMS Patients were riding motorcycles (55%), and 40% were riding mopeds (status unknown 
for 5%).  About two-thirds (65%) of all riders were wearing a helmet.  The proportion not wearing helmets was signifi -
cantly higher, nearly doubled, among the moped riders (68%), compared to motorcycle riders (38%).  Patient condition dif -
fered by helmet usage, as helmeted riders were significantly more likely to be transported with minor or moderate injuries 
(23%, compared to 19% for unhlemeted riders), and significantly less likely to be transported in critical condition (1.9% vs. 3.7%).  The mortality rate among helmeted riders (2.5%, or 31 of 1249) was also significantly less than that among unhelmeted riders (4.6%, or 86 of 1879).  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 12% of the patients, and alcohol users were significantly less likely to have worn helmets (14%, vs 41% among those with no alcohol use).
 Linked data from 2007 showed the odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death 
were 40% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, and the former also had more than twice the odds (2.2) of a fatal injury.  The protective effects of helmet use were magnified if only motorcycle riders were considered.  Unhelmeted motorcycle riders had twice the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, more than 3 times the odds of a fatal injury, and 3 times the odds of a TBI.
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
 About one-fourth (26%) of the injured resident motorcycle/moped riders in the HTR tested positive for alcohol, 
including 21% (178) with BAC levels of 0.08 or greater, and 14% (117) with BAC levels of 0.16% or greater.  Moped rid -
ers were significantly more likely than motorcyclists to have been drinking (31% vs 24%, respectively).  More than half (54%, or 464) of the riders tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, including most (78%) of the 285 moped riders.  Al-cohol usage was 4 times more common among those who crashed during night time (54%) compared to those who crashed between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (14%).
Motor vehicle crashes, pedestriansFatal injuries
 There was no statistically significant trend in the annual number of pedestrian fatalities, although the highest total 
occurred in 2007 (37 deaths).  Senior-aged residents comprised 47% of the victims, and the fatality rates increased dramati -
cally across the oldest age groups.  Most (69%) of the victims were hit on Oahu, but there were no significant differences in county-specific fatality rates.  Almost all (80%) of the victims who were 65 years or older were hit on Oahu, and the fatality rate for Oahu seniors was statistically comparable to that for seniors living on Neighbor Islands (36 vs. 22 deaths /100,000, respectively).

25 mph or slower zones, compared to 33% of pedestrians under the age of 65 years.  According to FARS data from 2007 to 2010, more than one-quarter (26%) of the 84 fatally injured pedestrians tested positive for alcohol, and 25% had BAC levels of 0.08% or higher.  Alcohol use was significantly higher among male victims (42%) compared to females (6%).  The highest prevalence of alcohol use was seen among victims in the 21 to 34 year age group (70%, or 7 of 10), and the 35 to 54 year age group (52%, or 11 of 21).  According to FARS data, 39% (33) of the pedestrian victims were in the roadway erroneously, most commonly by “improper crossing of roadway or intersection”, including jaywalking (21%, or 18 victims).  Including the victims who tested positive for alcohol or drugs, 54% (or 45) of the pedestrians made an error that contributed to the crash.  More than half (59%, or 52) of the 88 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash.  Most commonly, they were described as “inattentive” (38%), failed to yield the right of way (25%), or were speeding 
(18%).  
Nonfatal injuries
 The annual number of nonfatal injuries to pedestrians generally decreased from 649 in 2007 to 583 in 2011.  About 
one-quarter (23%) of the patients with nonfatal injuries were admitted to hospitals, the highest such proportion for any 
unintentional injury category.   Patient age was widely distributed, but one-third (33%) were in the 5 to 24 year age group.  This group also had the highest rate of nonfatal injuries that were treated in EDs, while senior aged residents had the highest rates of hospitalizations.

 The rates of both ED visits and all injuries (ED visits combined with hospitalizations) were lowest for Maui 
County residents, although all county-specific rates were statistically comparable.  Most (88%) of the nonfatal injuries were coded as “traffic” related, or occurring on a public roadway, while 12% were in “non-traffic” environments, including private roads, driveways and parking lots.  Thirty percent of the patients injured in non-traffic crashes were in the 1 to 14 year age group.  Patients were hospitalized for an average of 9 days, with nearly $60,000 in medical charges.  Hospitaliza -
tions accounted for most (73%) of total patient days and 87% of the $9.4 million in total medical char ges.   
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
 There were 2 peak periods for the time of the EMS-attended crashes, from 6:31 a.m. to 8:29 a.m. (13%, or 287 
crashes), and from 2:29 p.m. to 7:29 p.m. (35%, or 788 crashes).  The time distribution differed by patient age, as crashes with senior-aged pedestrians were more likely to occur during daytime hours (86%), compared to crashes involving pedes -
trians under 65 years of age (73%).  Patient condition differed by age, as senior-aged pedestrians were significantly more likely to be transported to a hospital, compared to pedestrians under 65 years of age (85% vs. 79%, respectively), and had a significantly higher mortality rate (10.3%, or 47 of 456, vs. 3.6%, or 67 of 1855).  The mortality rate was also significantly elevated among pedestrians who were hit during night time hours (7.4%, or 42 of 566), compared to those hit between 5:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (4.1%, or 72 of 1747), despite the younger age distribution among the former.  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.  Patients who had used alcohol had generally worse dispositions, and were more than three times as likely to require transport in critical condition, and nearly twice as likely to have died, compared to those 
who did not use alcohol.    624

significantly higher among those under 65 years of age (22%), as only 2% (3) of the 138 senior-aged pedestrians tested 
positive for alcohol.  Illicit drug usage was documented for 25% of the patients, including 30% of those who were under 65 years of age.  Alcohol use was nearly 8 times likely among pedestrians hit during night time hours (41%) than among 
those hit between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (5%).     
Motor vehicle crashes, bicyclists
Fatal injuries
 There were between 2 and 4 bicyclists killed in Hawaii each year, and 80% (12) of the 15 deaths occurred on 
Oahu.  There was no apparent high-risk age group.  Almost all (87%, or 13) of the bicyclists killed over the 5-year period were males.  Most (87%, or 13) of the victims were hit by a car; 2 others died after falling off their bicycles.  Only 2 of the victims were wearing helmets at the time of the crash (status unknown for 2 others).

 Almost all (91%, or 10) of the 11 traffic-related crashes (from 2007 to 2010) involved cars traveling straight on 
the road; only 1 crash was due to a car making a turn.  Two (18%) of the 11 bicyclists tested positive for alcohol, and 4 (36%) tested positive for drugs.  Overall, about half (54%, or 6) of the victims tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Besides substance use 2 bicyclists were traveling against traffic at the time of the crash and another failed to yield the right-of-way.  Four (36%) of the 11 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash, most commonly substance use and speeding (2 instances each).  
Nonfatal injuries
 There were more than 1200 nonfatal injuries to bicyclists each year, with a generally increasing trend.  Most 
(92%) of the injuries were treated in EDs.  Males comprised 75% of the patients, including 80% of those who were hos -
pitalized.  Nearly one-third (31%) of the patients were 5 to 14 years of age, and the injury rate for 5 to 14 year-olds (244 injuries/100,000 residents) were more than 3 times higher than the rate for residents of other ages (74/100,000).   234

 The injury rate for Kauai County residents was significantly higher than the rates for any other county, and 
approximately double the rate estimates for residents of Honolulu or Maui counties.  Almost all (85%) of the injuries were 
coded as “non-traffic”, or occurring on private roads, driveways, or off-road environments.  Most of the injuries treated in EDs (88%) and requiring hospitalization (71%) were coded to indicate crashes that did not involve a collision with another vehicle or object, but were probably due to the patient falling off of the bicycle.  Although 92% of the patients were treated in EDs, hospitalizations comprised 32% of the treatment days and 66% of the total medical charges of $5.8 million/year.  Most (63%) of the hospitalized patients had fractures, including 15% with skull fractures and 20% with leg fractures.  More than one-third (38%) of these patients had a traumatic brain injury .
EMS data and 2007 linked data (EMS, DOT, HHIC, FARS, death certificates)
 Most (73%) of the  EMS-attended bicyclist crashes were distributed over the 11-hour period of 7:31 a.m. to 6:29 
p.m., with a peak from 4:31 p.m. to 6:29 p.m. (17%).  About half (53%) of the injuries involved motor vehicles and 47% did not.  Only 27% of the injured bicyclists wore helmets.  Unhelmeted riders had a significantly higher proportion of “critical” or fatal injuries (2.1%, or 22 of 1031), compared to helmeted riders (0.7%, or 3 of 458).  These differences were accentuated among crashes that involved motor vehicles, as the proportion of unhelmeted bicyclists with critical or fatal injuries was 3.1% (17 of 540), compared to 0.9% (2 of 214) among helmeted riders.  Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients.  If only the bicyclists with known alcohol and helmet status were considered, helmet use was 5 times higher among those who did not consume alcohol (35%), compared to the drinkers (5%).  
 Linked data from 2007 showed odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death 
were 80% higher among unhelmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, although this estimate was only of “borderline” statistical significance (p=0.11).  
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
 Only 1 1% of the injured bicyclists in the HTR had been drinking at the time they were injured.  This percentage 
was nearly three times higher among those hurt in crashes that did not involve a motor vehicle compared to those who were hit by motor vehicles (15% vs. 6%, respectively).  About one-quarter of the bicyclists tested positive for illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (17%), and this proportion did not differ by the type of crash.  Overall, one-third (33%, or 89) of the 271 patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  None of the 28 bicyclists who had been drinking were wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, compared to 27% usage among those who tested negative for alcohol, and 31% among those who were not tested.  
Drownings (residents and non-residents)Fatal injuries
 There was no clear trend in the annual number of drownings, although the 79 deaths in 2011 was the highest total 
since at least 1993.  Most of the high total in 2011 was due to drownings on Honolulu and Maui counties.  About half (53%) of the victims were Hawaii residents, 36% from the U.S. mainland, and 12% from foreign countries.  The ages of 11691381

 Most (78%, or 259) of the victims drowned in the ocean or saltwater environments, almost all of whom (96%) 
were 18 years or older.  Unintentional immersions led to 13% of these drownings, including 31 victims who fell in or were swept into the ocean.  Other common activities were swimming (29% of victims), snorkeling (22%), and free diving (9%).  According to autopsy records, intrinsic or personal factors contributed to over half (61%) of the saltwater drownings in Honolulu County from 2007 to 2010.  The most common intrinsic factor was circulatory diseases, present among 46% of the victims of all ages, and 69% of those aged 50 years and older.  Only 13% of the victims tested positive for alcohol, and only 7% had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater.  Illicit drug use was considered a contribution to 12% of the drownings.  Apart from ocean drownings, there were 36 drownings in swimming pools, 21 in rivers and streams, and 12 in bathtubs.  Only 3 (8%) of the 36 victims who drowned in swimming pools were under 5 years of age, as victim age was widely dis -
tributed in this environment  
Nonfatal injuries (near drownings)
 There was no clear trend in the annual number of near drownings, which averaged 235 per year.  Hawaii residents 
comprised a slight majority (55%) of all patients treated for near drownings, but only 41% of those who were hospitalized.   ED patients were significantly younger on average than those who were hospitalized (31 vs. 40 years of age), with more than half (56%) in the 15 to 44 year age group.  Among Hawaii residents, county-specific rate estimates were generally comparable except for Hawaii and Maui county residents.

 Almost all (94%) of the incidents EMS responded to occurred during day time hours, including 80% between 9:31 
a.m. and 5:29 p.m.  More than half (59%) of the patients were Hawaii residents.  About 43% of the near drownings oc -
curred in bodies of water, which could include both freshwater and saltwater environments.  About one-third (30%) were in 
patient residences (10%), public buildings (12%), hotels (5%), and health care facilities (3%).  Most (77%) of the patients were either transported in “serious” (46%) or “critical” (32%) condition, with no significant differences in the distribution of patient condition between residents and non-residents.  Probable alcohol use was noted for only 4% of the patients.  Near drownings  that occurred during night time hours were significantly more likely to involve alcohol consumption than day time incidents, however (21% vs. 3%).  
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
 Only 8% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) HTR near drowning patients were positive for alcohol, and only 
9% tested positive for illicit drugs, although there was no toxicological testing for about two-thirds of the patients.  Sub -
stance use was somewhat higher among resident patients, although this comparison is limited by the small sample sizes and the lack of testing.
FallsFatal injuries
 Falls were the most common type of fatal unintentional injury in the state, with the 541 deaths accounting for 
25% of the total.  More than three-quarters (79%) of the victims were aged 65 years or older, and the risk of fatal falls increased dramatically across the senior age range.  Males comprised the majority (78%) of victims under 65 years of age, while gender was more equally distributed for the senior-aged victims.  Honolulu County residents comprised most of the victims of all ages (77%) and those who were 65 years or older (81%).  The fall fatality rate estimate for senior-aged residents of Honolulu County was significantly higher than the rates for residents of Kauai or Maui counties, and 45% higher than for Neighbor Island residents considered as a whole.

 Residents of Hawaii and Kauai counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal injuries from falls than residents 
of Honolulu and Maui counties.  The residents of Honolulu County had the lowest rates of hospitalizations.  Among the 
more specifically coded injuries, the most common causes were falls from stairs, steps and escalators (5.3% of the total), beds (3.7%), skateboards (3.5%), and chairs, playground equipment, and ladders (about 2% for each).  At least half (53%) of the falls that caused hospitalizations in seniors occurred in home environments.  This proportion increases to 84% if only records with specific information on location are considered.  The most common activity related to the falls was “walking, marching and hiking”, accounting for 30% of the total.  Skateboarding, running, tackle football, and bathing and showering were also prominent activities.  Hospitalizations averaged nearly 1 week in duration, resulted in over $31,000 in medical charges, and accounted for 72% ($84 million) of the total annual charges of $116.6 million.  Fractures were present in nearly three-fourths (74%) of the hospitalized patients, including 29% with hip fractures.  Additional data is presented for nonfatal falls specifically among senior-aged residents.
EMS data
 More than half (57%) of the EMS-attended falls occurred in the home or residence of the patient, and this propor -
tion was significantly higher among the seniors (71%) compared to younger aged patients (41%).  More than half (54%) of the patients were 65 years or older, including 22% who were 85 years or older.  Senior-aged patients had worse disposi -
tions, as they were more likely to be transported in serious condition (49%, compared to 40% of younger age patients) and less likely to be released at the scene (12% vs 19%, respectively).  Probable alcohol use was noted 8% of the patients, and male patients were more than twice as likely to have used alcohol compared to females (12% vs. 5%).  
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
 Only 1 1% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) HTR resident patients who were injured by falls were positive 
for alcohol, with 4 times higher use among patients in the 18 to 64 year age group (19%), compared to senior-aged patients (5%).  Fifteen percent of the patients tested positive for illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (11%).  Considered to-gether, about one-quarter (24%, or 587) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, although that proportion was much lower among the senior-aged patients (13%), compared to younger patients (36%).  
PoisoningsFatal injuries
 There was an increasing trend in the annual number of unintentional poisonings.  (There was no consistent trend 
in the number of poisonings of undetermined intent over this period.)  Victim age was narrowly distributed, as 58% were in the 45 to 64 year age range.  Males comprised 78% of the victims.  Most (82%) of the victims were poisoned on Oahu, and the highest fatality rates were computed for Honolulu County residents.  Inclusion of poisonings of undetermined intent resulted in significantly lower rates among Oahu residents compared to Hawaii or Maui county residents, so these compari -
sons are unreliable.  Drugs caused almost all (93%) of the poisonings, including 32% from “narcotics and hallucinogens” and 34% from “sedative-hypnotic and psychotropic drugs”.2302624634

Nonfatal injuries
 There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal poisonings, but this was evident only for ED visits among 
Honolulu and Maui county residents.  Gender was nearly equally distributed with 53% male patients.  Patient age was 
broadly distributed, although one-quarter (26%) were 1 to 14 years of age.  Seniors comprised only 13% of all patients, but (23%) of those who were hospitalized.  Rates of ED visits were highest by far for residents under 5 years of age, nearly 5 times higher than the rate for all other age groups.  Residents of Honolulu and Maui counties had comparable injury rates, significantly lower than the rates for residents of Hawaii and Kauai counties.

 Patients were hospitalized for slightly over 3 days on average, with nearly $18,000 in medical charges.  Most 
(76%) of the poisonings were caused by drugs or medicinal substances, including 92% of those that required hospitaliza-tion.  Narcotics caused 21% of the hospitalizations, tranquilizers 13%, aromatic analgesics (which include acetaminophen, or Tylenol) 8%, and cardiovascular agents 8%.  
SuffocationsFatal injuries
 The annual number of suffocations varied inconsistently between 24 and 37 deaths.  The age distribution was 
bimodal, as most (68%) victims were 75 years or older, but there were also 24 victims (16%) who were under 4 years of age.  Twenty-two of the victims were infants, all but 3 of whom suffocated in their beds or sleeping environments.  Most (89%) of the victims suffocated on Oahu, including 92% of those who were 65 years and older.  The most commonly speci -
fied causes were inhalation of food (19% of suffocations) or gastric contents (2%).  Most (58%) were coded as inhalation of “other objects” with little further detail available.  Including deaths from SIDS and “unspecified causes of mortality” as well as infant suffocations, there was an average of 15 infant deaths a year that were sleep-related or possibly sleep-related, with no trend in the annual number.   91120

Nonfatal injuries
 There was a decreasing trend in the overall number of nonfatal suffocations in the state, due mostly to decreases 
in ED visits over the 2008-2010 period.    More than half (53%) of the patients were under 5 years of age.  Senior-aged 
residents comprised 58% of the patients who were hospitalized.  Males comprised a slight majority (53%) of the patients.  Oahu residents comprised 59%  of the patients, but rates of ED visits for nonfatal suffocations were significantly higher among residents of Neighbor Islands (14 visits per year/100,000 residents) compared to Oahu residents (9 visits/100,000).

 More than half (61%) of the hospitalizations were caused by the inhalation of food and somewhat less commonly

tions, while inhalation of foods caused 38%.  Almost all (97%) the suffocations were diagnosed as “foreign body entering 
through orifice”.
Intentional injuries
Suicides and suicide attempts
Fatal injuries
 There was a generally increasing trend in the number of suicides in the state, and the 195 deaths in 2010 was by 
far the highest total in the 21-year period (1991 to 2011) for which data was available.  Victim age was widely distributed, although almost all (95%) were 19 years or older.  The highest fatality rates were computed for residents aged 45 to 54 years and those 85 years and older.  Male victims outnumbered females by approximately 3-to-1.  More than half (58%) of the victims were residents of Oahu, but the fatality rate for Oahu (58/100,000 residents) was significantly lower than the rate for the combined Neighbor Islands (94/100,000).  2437

The most common mechanism was by hanging or suffocation (49% of the suicides), followed by firearm use (20%).  Most 
(65%) of the Oahu victims had a documented history of mental illness (as variously defined), according to autopsy records from 2007 to 2010.  The most common negative life events for the victims were related to intimate relationship problems (34%), usually a break-up or divorce (12%), or serious illness or medical issues (26%).  The latter was documented for 60% of the senior-aged victims.  Over one-third (37%) had a history of substance abuse, 19% had a BAC level over 0.08%, and 34% tested positive for illicit drugs.  Nearly one-third (32%) of the victims had a previous suicide attempt documented in the record, and more than half (56%) had verbally threatened suicide.  
Nonfatal injuries
 There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal suicide attempts, which was only evident in the annual 
number of injuries that were treated in EDs.  Slightly more than half (56%) of the injuries were treated in EDs, unlike most types of injuries.  Most (58%) of the patients were under 35 years of age, and residents aged 15 to 19 years had the highest rates of hospitalizations and especially ED visits.  The gender distribution of patients was similar for both settings, with females comprising 57% of the total.

Residents of Kauai and Hawaii counties had significantly higher rates of nonfatal self-inflicted injuries compared to residents 
of Honolulu and Maui counties.  Over half (58%) of the ED visits and most (85%) of the hospitalizations were caused by poisonings from drugs or medicinal substances, most commonly from the “analgesics, antipyretics, and antirheumatics” class (22% of ED visits, 33% of hospitalizations), which includes both narcotics (heroin, and other opiates), as well as aspirin and acetaminophen.  Female patients were more likely to attempt by drug or medicinal poisonings (76%, vs. 62% for male patients).131169

Fatal injuries
 There were 112 victims of homicide over the 5-year period, with a significantly decreasing trend from 29 in 2008 
to 17 in 2011.   More than half (58%) of the victims were in the 25 to 54 year age range, but there were also 6 victims (5%) who were under 5 years of age.  Males comprised 59% of the victims.   The fatality rate for residents of Oahu (8.8 deaths/100,000 residents) was statistically comparable to the rate for all Neighbor Island residents (8.4/100,000).

The most common method was the use of firearms (35%), followed by stabbings (28%), and physical force or unarmed 
beatings (25%).  According to Uniform Crime Reports from 2007 to 2009, most (73%) of the homicide victims knew their assailant, and only a minority (19%) were killed by strangers.  Female victims were most likely to be killed by their intimate partner (37%, vs. 5% of male victims), while males were most likely to be killed by extra-familial acquaintances (40%) or strangers (25%).
Nonfatal injuries
 There were over 4200 nonfatal injuries from assaults among Hawaii residents each year, with no clear trend over 
time.  Males comprised two-thirds (67%) of the patients treated in EDs and an even greater proportion (89%) of those who were hospitalized.  More than half (58%) of the patients were 15 to 34 years of age; few (5%) were under 15 years of age, or over 65 years of age (1%).  The peak age for rates of both ED visits and hospitalizations was the 15 to 29 year age group, particularly 20 to 24 year-olds.

17EMS data
 The number of EMS-attended incidents generally increased over the course of the day (starting at 6 a.m.), reaching 
a broad peak during the 7:31 p.m. to 2:29 a.m. period (48% of the total).  The home or residence of the patient was the most 
common location for the assault (40%), followed by other indoor location or buildings (17%), most commonly “public buildings” (7%), and bars and restaurants (6%).  One-fifth (20%) of the patients were transported in serious or critical condition.  That proportion was highest among the senior-aged victims (29%).  Probable alcohol use was noted for 29% of the patients.  Patients who had consumed alcohol were significantly less likely to be released at the scene (34%, vs. 52% for other patients), and twice as likely to be transported in serious condition (31% vs. 15%, respectively).    
Hawaii Trauma Registry (toxicology data)
 Nearly half (46%) of the adult-aged (18 years and older) HTR resident patients who were injured by assaults 
were positive for alcohol, and more than one-third (38%) tested positive for illicit drugs.  About three-fourths (76%, or 286) of the 375 drinkers had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater.  THC was the most commonly documented drug (19% of the patients), followed by amphetamines (15%) and narcotics (15%).  Considered together, about two-thirds (67%) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Alcohol use was significantly more likely among the male patients (49%) compared to females (27%), among those injured on weekends (54% vs. 41% for those assaulted on weekdays), and among those assaulted during night time hours (54%, vs. 30% for those injured between 6:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m.).  18Data Sources and MethodologyData Sources and Methodology The primary source of injury mortality data in Hawaii is the death certificate database of the Hawaii Department 
of Health.  The ICD-10 underlying cause of death codes were grouped as recommended by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, with some exceptions.1  For some types of injuries, the open text information on how the injury 
occurred was reviewed to extract information not captured by the cause of death code.  Supplemental data was also used for certain injury categories.  Data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System
2 (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) was linked to death certificate data for deaths from traffic crashes.  Supplemental data on homicides was abstracted from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), maintained by the National Archive of Criminal Justice data.
3  The autopsy records of Oahu suicide and drowning victims were also reviewed for the 2007 to 2010 period.  
 Fatal injuries are described within the main intent categories of unintentional injuries (drownings, car crashes, 
etc.) and intentional injuries (homicides and suicides), as defined by the CDC recommended framework.¹  Unintentional injuries are described both as a total and separately within the 8 main mechanisms: motor vehicle crashes involving occupants, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists, and falls, drownings, poisonings, and suffocations.  The intent of the fatal injury could not be determined for some injuries, and these are described as a total in one of the final chapters.  
 One section of this document compares general injury mortality in Hawaii versus that in the rest of the United 
States.  The national data comes from the WISQARS4 (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) online 
database, accessed at the web site for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The fatality totals from this database were adjusted for the portion of deaths among Hawaii residents.  WISQARS mortality data beyond 2009 was not available.  The period of 2005 to 2009 was chosen in order to allow for 5-year comparisons of injury mortality between Hawaii and the rest of the United States.  FARS data was used to compare Hawaii fatality rates from traffic crashes versus the rest of the U.S., since the WISQARS data contains a high proportion of records coded as “other” or “unspecified” for victims killed in traffic crashes.  FARS data is more specific in this regard, i.e. able to distinguish automobile occupants from motorcyclists from pedestrians.  State comparisons with the FARS data covered the 4-year period from 2007 to 2010. 
 The cal culation of injury mortality rates necessitates the definition of “at risk” populations for the denominator.  
For the section comparing U.S. and Hawaii fatality rates, the denominator was the average annual resident population over the 2005 to 2009 period.  This data was obtained from the web site for the U.S. Census Bureau.
5  Other analyses compared 
rate estimates of the 4 counties within Hawaii, using the average annual population estimate over the 2007 to 2010, since 2011 estimates were not available when preparation of this report began.  Some injury rates were computed and compared for specific ethnicities.  Ethnicity was assigned using the first-listed ethnicity on the death certificate.  Ethnic-specific rates were computed using resident population estimates from the 2010 U.S. Census.
6  The “alone or in any combination” 
enumerations were used for all ethnicities.  The results of these analyses were not substantially different when the “alone” enumerations were used, except for Hawaiians.  Since there were too few deaths within some of the ethnicities to adjust the rates for age distribution, comparisons were made using “crude” or unadjusted rate estimates.  For these reasons, the results from these ethnic-specific comparisons should be interpreted with caution.  For motor vehicle crashes, the 2009 National Household Travel Survey provided an alternative to population estimates as a measure of exposure.  NHTS included estimates of the number of person trips taken by different modes of transportation, for over 7,100 Hawaii residents.
7
 This report includes mostly information on injuries among residents of Hawaii.  This is consistent with national 
reporting conventions of injury mortality and allows for the comparison of fatal and nonfatal injury rates in Hawaii with rates for the remainder of the country.  Since age and county-specific population estimates are also available only for residents, the inclusion of injuries among non-residents would result in a slight overestimation of mortality and morbidity rates.  There were 339 total injury-related deaths of non-residents over the 5-year period, or about 9% of the total.  As this is a considerable number of deaths, there is a separate section of the document which examines these deaths (and nonfatal injuries) in more detail.  In general, however, exclusion of deaths among non-residents does not significantly impact the description of the remaining fatal injuries in this document.  Residents represented at least 92% of the victims in the major injury categories, with the exception of drownings, 53% of which occurred among non-residents.  There is therefore a separate section on drowning which includes information on both resident and non-resident victims.  
 Also excluded from this report were 42 deaths that were due to “adverse effects” of medical treatment; injuries 
resulting from surgical or medical care, or adverse reactions to drugs or medicinal substances.  These iatrogenic events generally occur outside of the usual public health context of injury prevention.  Data Sources and Methodology
19 The source of data on nonfatal injuries was the Hawaii Health Information Corporation (HHIC), which receives 
abstracted data from the medical records of patients treated in all hospital-based emergency departments (EDs) and 
hospitals in the state, with the exception of  ED records from Tripler Army Medical Center.  A record was defined as injury-related if the principle diagnosis was within the ICD-9CM series 800-995.85, with the following exclusions: 909.3, 909.5, 995.0-995.4, 995.6-995.7.
8  Patients who died in the hospitals or who were discharged to hospice facilities were excluded 
from these analyses.  To prevent double-counting of injuries, patients who were transferred to another hospital at discharge were excluded.  Injuries resulting from “adverse effects”, as indicated by external cause of injury codes (E-codes),
9 were 
also excluded.  E-codes were used to group nonfatal injuries into mechanisms that corresponded to the groupings for fatal injuries.
9  In this report, all nonfatal self-inflicted injuries are described as “suicide attempts”, although this is not actually 
discernible through E-codes.  This may have resulted in an overestimation of suicide attempts, but it is also possible that self-inflicted injuries in general are underreported.  
 It is important to note that the extent of E-coding varied across the counties patients reside in, and over time within 
those counties (Table 1).  The records for residents of Neighbor Islands were significantly more likely to have E-codes than records for residents of Honolulu County (on average 97.4% vs. 87.5%, respectively).  There were also decreasing trends in the proportion of inpatient records with E-codes for all counties except Maui, although these were most meaningful for Oahu hospitals.  Closer examination indicated most of the decrease in E-coding at Oahu hospitals was due to 3 of the 12 facilities that contribute to the HHIC database.  These variations in E-coding need to be considered when interpreting comparisons between counties and examining trends within a county over time.  Most statistics in this report are based only on E-coded records, and therefore underestimate the real magnitude of injuries by about 9% for both those treated at EDs and for those injuries requiring hospitalizations.
 E-coding also varied slightly by age of patient and the treatment setting.  E-coding was most complete for ED 
records for infants (93.3%), and progressively decreased to 90.4 among 25 to 34 year-old patients, before maintaining that level among older-aged patients.  There was an opposite pattern for the inpatient records, with the lowest level of E-coding for infant patients (80.1%), but progressively increasing to 91.2% for records for 35 to 44 year-old and successively older patients.  For all HHIC records considered together, the level of E-coding was highest for the records of infant patients (92.7%), followed by 1 to 14 year-old patients (92.2%), and varied between 90.2% and 91.0% for the records of older-aged patients.  
 There was some inconsistency in the contribution to the HHIC database from certain individual hospitals.  One 
Oahu hospital began contributing ED records in November, 2008, although this hospital accounted for only 1.4% of ED records.  Two other Oahu hospitals closed operations in mid-December of 2011.  
 EMS data is included in certain chapters (motor vehicle crashes, falls and assaults) for which there were discreet 
injury codes in the EMS data collection system.  Data was available for all 4 county agencies over the 2007 to 2011 period, but there were some limitations related to a software change for parts of 2008 and 2009.  For this reason, examination of trends is not possible with EMS data.  EMS data, however, does document use of protective equipment (seat belts and helmets) and the approximate time and location of the injury, elements which are lacking from the more population-based HHIC data.  Patient use of alcohol and drugs is also noted in EMS data, either by patient admission, the smell of alcohol on the breath, or physical evidence (e.g. bottles, drug paraphernalia, etc.) at the scene.  However, since use of “drugs” is not specific, only the  EMS characterization of patient alcohol use is examined.  To avoid double-counting of individual patients, those who were transferred to another EMS unit were excluded from analyses.  Patients who refused transport to hospitals (or released at the scene) and those who were dead upon EMS arrival or who died while in EMS care were included, however, to provide a full description of the effects of protective factors or alcohol use.  
 
 EMS data also includes the location of the incident, to the nearest census tract.  This information was used to 
map the locations of injuries from motor vehicle crashes, bicycle crashes, drownings and near-drownings (including non-residents), and assaults.  The resulting maps are not a complete capture of EMS-attended injuries, however, given the data lapse described above.  Also, some injury cases were identified through supplementary fields (e.g. dispatch complaint), which were not uniformly present or utilized across all 4 county EMS agencies at all times.  For these reasons, the most appropriate use of these maps is to compare the geographical frequencies of injuries within each county; the reliability of cross-county comparisons is uncertain. Data Sources and Methodology
20 A grant from the Hawaii Department of Transportation (DOT) enabled the linkage of 2007 EMS records related to 
motor vehicle crashes to DOT, HHIC, and FARS, and death certificate records.  EMS records were linked to DOT, FARS 
and death certificate records probabilistically, on the basis of time, date, and location of the crash, and patient age, gender and seating position.  This product was then linked to HHIC records by deterministic methods using patient identifiers, including name and date of birth.  This linked dataset provided examination of the effect of protective devices (as described by EMS, DOT and FARS) with the ultimate medical disposition of the patients (as described by HHIC records and death certificates).  
 More complete and test-based results of toxicology were available from the Hawaii Trauma Registry.  The HTR 
includes data from the 7 main trauma centers in the state.  Data was available for the 2008 to 2011 period, but 6 of the trauma centers did not begin contributing data until 2009.  The amount of toxicologic testing varied across facilities and within facilities over time, so it was not possible to compare results across counties or examine trends over time.  HTR data was included to provide a description of substance use among patients who had nonfatal (although serious) injuries from a variety of mechanisms.  To avoid double-counting, the results of HTR patients who were transferred at discharge were excluded.  Patients who died, either in the ED or after hospitalization, were included, to examine associations between substance use and mortality for injuries where these relationships are not better described through other data systems (e.g. motor vehicle deaths and FARS).  
 Age-standardization was by the direct method, using the U.S. 2000 standard population.10  Sixteen age groups 
were used for standardization across all ages, although certain calculations were restricted to more narrow age ranges.  Statistical tests were conducted with t-tests for continuously distributed variables (e.g. patient age) and chi-squared tests for categorical variables (e.g. patient gender).
11  Some trends (described as “significant” or “non-significant”) were formally 
assessed using Poisson regression.12  Rate differences were tested using different techniques, depending on sample size and 
use of age standardization.13  All statistical significance testing was conducted at the 95% confidence level.  Data Sources and Methodology

22Overview of Injuries Among Hawaii Residents
Fatal injuries
 There were 3,355 injury-related deaths among the residents of Hawaii over the 5-year period.  This total repre -
sented 7.5% of the 47,245 total number of deaths that occurred among Hawaii residents during this period.  Unintentional 
injuries were the fourth leading cause of death for residents of all ages, and the leading cause of death for those aged 1 to 40 years (Figure 1).  In fact, injuries accounted for more deaths in this age group than all other causes combined.  Suicides and injuries of undetermined intent were also prominent categories of overall mortality in this age range.

23 The importance of injuries 
as the leading cause of death among 
children and young adults is shown in Figure 2.  Injuries accounted for 40% of all deaths among children aged 1 to 14 years, and almost three-fourths of those among decedents aged 15 to 24 years.  Injuries also caused the major -
ity of deaths among 25-34 year-olds, and one-third of those among 35-44 year-olds.  Overall, almost half (48%) of all deaths among residents aged 1 to 44 years were injury related.  Inju -
ries were the leading cause of years of potential life lost before the age of 65 among state residents.  Over the 5-year period, a total of 60,287 person years of life were lost before the age of 65 due to fatal injuries.  In comparison, 36,820 years of life be -
fore age 65 were lost due to cancer, and 26,229 due to heart disease.   
 The majority (64%) of the 
3,355 injury-related deaths were classified as unintentional (Figure 3).  Suicides constituted 24% of the total, homicides 3%, and injuries of undetermined intent the remaining 8%.  Each of these four categories of fatal injuries will be discussed in more detail in the following sec -
tions.

among Hawaii residents, by intent, 2007-2011.
(Rates for al l types of injuries are indicated by bars.)
 The leading causes of fatal injuries varied by the age group of the victims (Figure 5).  Suffocation was a leading 
cause of injury mortality in the very youngest and oldest age groups, but not in the intervening ages.  Car crashes were 
the 2nd leading cause of injury mortality among 1 to 34 year olds, but this category decreased in rank across most of the succeeding age groups.  Suicide was the leading cause of injury mortality among victims aged 15 to 74 years, although falls were a far more frequent cause in the oldest age group.  Poisonings were common only among the 15 to 64 year-old victims, but the 3rd leading cause for all ages.  The associations between age and other demographic variables will be explored more fully for each category in later sections of this report. Annual rates of fatal injuries 
are shown by the main intent catego -
ries in Figure 4.  There was no sig -
nificant trend for the rate of all fatal injuries, although there was a signifi-cantly increasing trend in the rate of suicides.  The fatality rate for suicides increased by 42% over the 5-year period, and by 93% over the 2007 to 2010 period.  The fatality rate for un -
intentional injuries decreased signifi-cantly by 23% over the 2007 to 2010 period, but the subsequent increase in 2011 translated into no significant trend over the entire 5-year period.  There was no significant trend for the homicide rate over the 5 years, but a significant decrease (of 68%) over the 2008 to 2011 period.  The trends for deaths of undetermined intent were relatively flat.

25Nonfatal injuries
 There was an annual average of 85,556 nonfatal injuries that required treatment at Hawaii hospitals over the 
5-year period (Table 2).  Most (93%, or 79,576) of those were treated in the ED setting, as these less severe injuries 
outnumbered those requiring hospital admission (5980 per year) by over a 13-to-1 ratio.  Among residents of Honolulu County, there were generally consistent increases in the annual number of both nonfatal injuries treated in EDs and those requiring hospitalization.   In contrast, the number of nonfatal injuries requiring hospitalization generally decreased among residents of other counties.  Since the estimated population increased by at least 6% in each county over the 2007 through 2010 period, however, there were significantly decreasing trends in the annual rates of nonfatal injuries, at either level of hospital treatment.  The only exceptions were ED visits among Kauai County residents, and hospitalizations among resi -
dents of Honolulu County.

26 Most of the injuries treated in EDs (92.7%) and requiring hospitalization (86.2%) were coded as unintentional 
or “accidental” (Table 3).  These proportions were fairly constant across the 4 counties.  Assaults constituted 3% to 6% 
of injuries treated in both settings, while self-inflicted or suicidal injuries comprised a much greater proportion of injuries requiring hospitalization (6.7%), compared to injuries treated in EDs (0.6%).  Injuries of undetermined intent generally comprised less than 2% of the injuries treated in EDs or requiring hospitalization

 Residents of Kauai had the 
highest rate of nonfatal injuries treat-ed in EDs, nearly double the rates computed for residents of Honolulu and Maui counties (left side of Fig -
ure 6).  The rate for Hawaii County residents was also significantly high-er than rates for Honolulu and Maui counties, but 23% lower than the rate for Kauai County.  There was a dif-ferent pattern for rates of hospitaliza -
tions, as residents of Honolulu had a significantly lower rate than residents of Hawaii or Maui counties.  The hos-pitalization rates for Hawaii, Kauai and Maui counties were statistically comparable, although 6% to 17% higher than the rate for residents of Honolulu County.  The combined rate (nonfatal injuries in either setting) for residents of Maui and Honolulu counties were statistically comparable (597/1,000 and 608/1,000, respec -
tively), while the rate for residents of Kauai and Hawaii counties were significantly different than any other county (1075/1,000 and 840/1,000, respectively). Figure 6. Age adjusted annual rates of nonfatal injuries requiring

40  Males comprised about 54% 
of Hawaii residents who were hospi-
talized for nonfatal injuries, and males had significantly higher (by 37%) rates of hospitalization for nonfatal injuries compared to female residents (Figure 7).  Rate differences were greatest in the 20 to 24 age group, gradually narrowing over the adult age range before becoming compa-rable for ages 60 to 74 years.  Females had significantly higher rates among residents aged 75 years and older. Figure 7. Average annual rates (per 10,000 residents) of hospitalization for 
nonfatal injuries in Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
*Indicates non-significant difference in rates between males and females.
 There was a slightly greater 
gender disparity for nonfatal injuries that were treated in EDs, as the rate for male residents was 41% higher than that for females (Figure 8).  Male patients outnumbered females overall (59% vs. 41%), but gender distribu -
tion varied by age.  Males comprised nearly two-thirds (65%) of the pa-tients aged 10 to 29 years, but females made up the majority (60%) of those 65 years and older.  These relation -
ships were reflected in the age-specif-ic rate estimates, where the greatest gender differences were seen for the 10 to 29 year age range, especially among males aged 15 to 19 who had the highest rates.  Rates declined in both genders over the 15 to 74 year age range, before increasing.  Females aged 75 and older had significantly higher rates than male residents. Figure 8.

29 The lea ding causes of nonfatal injuries differed between those requiring hospitalization (Figure 9) and those 
treated in EDs (Figure 10), and also differed by patient age within each of those settings.  Falls were the leading cause 
of injuries requiring hospitalization at nearly every age group except for 15 to 34 year-old patients, among whom motor vehicle occupant injuries were the most common.  Car crashes and suicide attempts were the 2nd leading cause for most age groups, although assaults were the 2nd most common cause among infants.  Poisonings were prominent causes of hospitalizations for senior age groups, while assaults and motorcycle crashes were more common for patients aged 15 to 64 years.

30 Falls were also the leading cause of nonfatal injuries that were treated in EDs for all ages considered together and 
within most age groups (Figure 10).  Injuries from being “struck by objects or persons” were the leading cause for 15 to 
34 year-olds, and the 2nd leading cause for the youngest (under 15 years of age) and oldest (75 years and older) patients.  Cutting and piercing injuries were prominent, being the 3rd leading cause among 1 to 44 year-old patients.  Most of these (57%) were coded as injuries from “other” objects, including broken glass and nails.  Knives caused 21% of these injuries, and 4% were from powered hand tools.  Car crashes were the 5th leading cause overall.

 The rate of fatal injuries in 
Hawaii was significantly lower (by 17%) than the rate for the rest of the U.S.  Figure 11 shows there were significant differences in the rates of injuries for each type of intent.  Fatal unintentional injury rates were 21% lower in Hawaii, and homicide rates in Hawaii were one-third of those for the rest of the U.S.  The suicide rate for Hawaii residents was signifi -
cantly lower than that for the rest of the U.S., but the rate of fatal injuries of undetermined intent was 3 times higher in Hawaii.  This makes the in -
terpretation of the respective suicide rates problematic, since most of the deaths of undetermined intent in Ha-waii are thought to be possible sui -
cides (see Figure 170).
 Fatality rates among car 
occupants were 58% lower for Ha -
waii residents, compared to other U.S. residents (Figure 12).  This was the primary reason for the low rate of fatal unintentional injuries in Hawaii, compared to the rest of the U.S.  Fatality rates for motorcyclists were significantly higher for Hawaii residents, but represented a less fre -
quent cause of death.  Drowning was the only other category for which the rate in Hawaii was significantly higher than that for the rest of the U.S.  Rates of fatal falls and suffoca-tions, and deaths among pedestrians were statistically comparable be -
tween Hawaii and the remaining U.S. residents.  Hawaii had a significantly lower rate (by 34%) of unintentional poisonings, and also a significantly lower rate (by only 12%) if poison -
ings of all intent categories were considered (56 deaths/100,000 Hawaii residents, vs. 63/100,000 residents of other States).  (Mode-specific traffic fatality rates are more reliably computed with FARS data (see figures 15 through 18), due to the sometimes imprecise characterization offered by death certificates.  However, they are presented as part of this figure to disaggregate the overall difference in unintentional injury fatality rates shown in Figure 11.)Figure 11.

significantly lower in Hawaii than in 
the rest of the U.S. for most of the age groups shown in Figure 13.  The most pronounced differences were in early adulthood (from 15 to 34 years of age).  The shape of the curve in Ha -
waii was otherwise similar to the rest of the U.S.  In Hawaii, rates were rela -
tively low during childhood, began to rise around 15 years of age, and then leveled off until a dramatic increase at about 75 years of age. Figure 13. Five-year rates (/100,000) of fatal injuries among Hawaii

 Fatality rates from traffic 
crashes were significantly lower for 
Hawaii residents compared to the rest of the United States for most age groups, and 26% lower overall (Figure 15).  Hawaii (including both resident and non-resident victims) had the 42nd highest fatality rate among the 50 states, which ranged from 108 deaths/100,000 (Wyoming), to 21 deaths/100,000 (Massachusetts).  For both Hawaii and the rest of the U.S., the age pattern was similar: low-est rates through age 14, then rising sharply to a peak in the 15 to 29 year age group, followed by a gradual de -
cline through age 64, before increas -
ing again among senior-aged victims. Figure 15. Four-year rates (/100,000) of fatal injuries from traffic crashes, 
Hawaii vs. rest of the U.S., by age group, 2007-2010.
(FARS data, which includes non-resident fatalities, 
but excludes non-traffic crashes.)
*Denotes statistically significant difference in rate between Hawaii (including deaths among residents and non-residents) and rest of U.S.
 There was an even larger dis -
crepancy when comparing car occu -
pant fatality rates, as the rate for Ha -
waii residents and non-residents was about half (44% lower) that for the rest of the U.S. (Figure 16).  Statisti -
cally significant difference were noted for nearly every age group above age 14.  The rate of 19 death/100,000 for Hawaii was only the 46th highest rate among states.  As per total traffic-related fatalities, Wyoming had the highest rate (90/100,000), and Massa-chusetts had the lowest (14/100,000).  Since car occupants comprised the majority (72%) of traffic crash fatali -
ties for the rest of the U.S., the age pattern is similar to that for all types of traffic-related fatalities (Figure 15): the sharp rise in rates for 15 to 24 year-olds, a general decline in rates for successive age groups until an in -
crease among ages 65 and older. Figure 16. Four-year rates (/100,000) of fatal traffic injuries among car

 The age-standardized mo-
torcyclist fatality rate for Hawaii 
residents was significantly greater than that for the rest of the U.S., and Figure 17 shows this is mostly due to elevated rates in the 20 to 29 year age groups in Hawaii.  Overall, rates for Hawaii residents and non-residents were 50% greater, but 73% higher for this age range (19 deaths/100,000 for Hawaii, vs. 11 for the rest of the U.S.).  Fatality rates generally declined from the peak age of 20 to 24 years for both Hawaii and the rest of the U.S.  For all ages, Hawaii (including both resi-dent and non-resident victims) had the 10th highest fatality rate among the 50 states, with Wyoming again with the highest rate (15 deaths/100,000 (Wy-oming), and Massachusetts the lowest rate (3 deaths/100,000)  Figure 17.

 The all-ages pedestrian fa -
tality rates were statistically compa-rable between Hawaii and the rest of the U.S. over the 4-year period (Figure 18).  However, rates among senior-aged residents were signifi-cantly higher in Hawaii, with a more than two-fold difference for each se-nior age group.  Although the high-est rates for the rest of the U.S. were also seen among seniors, they were only about twice as high compared to rates among those 64 years of age and younger (9 vs. 5 deaths/100,000), while for Hawaii the rates for victims aged 65 years and older (22/100,000) were over 5 times higher than for younger residents (4/100,000).  Fa-tality rates for almost all age groups younger than 65 years were statisti -
cally comparable between Hawaii and the rest of the U.S., with rates generally increasing with age.  
 Hawaii had the 13th high -
est all-ages fatality rate among the 50 states, but by far the highest rate among senior-aged residents (22 deaths/100,000, compared to the next-highest rate of 15/100,000 for California).  Hawaii had the highest senior-aged fatality rate in the country, whether computed with age adjusting or not, and whether including non-resident deaths or not.  In fact, Hawaii had the highest rates within each of the 3 age groups in the senior age range.  Figure 18. Four-year rates (/100,000) of fatal traffic injuries among

 The rate of hospitalizations 
for nonfatal injuries was significantly 
lower (by 20%) for Hawaii residents compared to the U.S. as a whole (Figure 21).  The rate was higher for Hawaii residents under 15 years of age, comparable for the 15 through 24 year age group, then higher for US residents at every succeeding age group.  The largest discrepancies were computed for the 40 through 49 year age groups.  Figure 21 also shows the association between age and rate of hospitalization was simi-lar for Hawaii and the U.S.: rates were lowest for 5 to 14 year-olds, increased from ages 15 to 24, then stayed relatively constant until large successive increases beginning at 65 years of age.  Rates for residents 75 years and older were 2 to 8 times higher than rates for most other age groups.  Similar findings were noted when analyzing hospitalization rates within each gender.  The standardized rate for Hawaii male residents was 43% higher than the rate for female residents of Hawaii (51 vs. 36 hospi -
talizations/10,000 residents).
 The age adjusted rate of ED 
visits for nonfatal injuries was 48% higher for the U.S. as a whole com -
pared to rates for Hawaii residents (Figure 22).  There were statistically significant differences in the rates at every age group, but the biggest dif-ferences were seen for the 20 to 34 year age ranges.  The relationship be -
tween age and rates of ED visits was similar for Hawaii residents and the U.S., with peak rates in the 15 to 24 year age group and the 85 and older age group.  A different pattern was seen for hospitalization rates, where there was a pronounced peak in the oldest age groups (see Figure 21).  Rates of ED visits generally declined over the 24 to 74 year age range in both places.  These patterns were also evident within each gender.  Among Hawaii residents, the standardized rate for males (72/1,000 residents) was 44% higher than the rate for females (50/1,000 residents.)Figure 21.

 Motor vehicle traffic crashes 
were the dominant cause of the 2,159 
unintentional injury deaths (Figure 23), although falls were the single leading cause.  Deaths from poison-ings accounted about nearly one-fifth of the total number of unintentional injury deaths.  The 635 combined vehicular deaths accounted for 30% of the total number of unintentional injury deaths, including 328 deaths among drivers and occupants of mo -
tor vehicles (excluding motorcycles).  Other common causes of uninten -
tional injury deaths were drownings (7.6%), and suffocations (7.2%).  The following sections will discuss these more common unintentional injury categories in more detail.
 Unintentional injury deaths 
occurred at all ages, but Figure 24 below shows two particularly notice-able peaks: young adults (ages 15-64) and the elderly (over 75 years).  Male victims outnumber females by more than 2-to-1, as 71% (1,533) of the 2,159 victims of unintentional inju -
ries were males, and 29% (626) were females.  Figure 24 shows that this gender disparity was lowest among the youngest (ages 0 to 14) and oldest (ages 75 and older) victims, although this equality in the latter is at least partly due to the relative longevity of females.
 The age distribution varied 
somewhat by the category of injury death.  For example, while drown-ings and bicyclist deaths were more evenly distributed across the age range, 80% of the fall victims were 65 years of age or older.  Similarly, there was some variation in the pro-portion of gender by the category of injury.  Males formed the vast major -
ity of victims who died in motorcycle crashes (88%), bicycle crashes (88%), drownings (88%), and poisonings (78%).  Although males still represented the majority, gender was more equally distributed among victims of falls (56%) and pedestrian fatalities (56%).  The age and gender distribution of victims will be examined more closely in specific injury sections.Figure 23.  Fatal unintentional injuries among residents of Hawaii, 
by injury category, 2007-2011.  
*mvc=motor vehicle crash.  #Most of these (87, or 61%) were due to “exposure to unspecified factor”.  There were 
also 6 electrocutions,  and 39 deaths due to “late effects” (more than 1 year) from falls (14), car crashes (8) and unspecified mechanisms (17).

84  More than two-thirds (69%, 
or 1,490) of the unintentional injuries 
occurred in Honolulu County.   Of the remaining 669 fatalities on the Neighbor Islands, about half (51%, or 339) occurred in Hawaii Coun-ty.  There were 221 deaths in Maui County (10% of the state total), and 109 in Kauai County (7%).  
 Although the number of fa -
talities was by far greatest on Oahu, Figure 25 shows the rate was highest for residents of Hawaii County.  The rates for Hawaii County was at least 17% higher than any other county, and significantly higher than the rates for Honolulu or Maui counties.  The rates for Kauai, Maui and Honolulu counties were statistically compa-rable.  
 Figure 26 shows that unin -
tentional injury rates were higher for Hawaii County residents at all ages, except for the youngest and oldest age groups.  (Rates among residents 85 years and older are not shown, to conserve the scale of the graph.  The rate for Hawaii County resi-dents aged 85 and older was 1,064 deaths/100,000 residents, while the rate for the rest of the state was 1,256/100,000 residents.)  Compared to residents of other parts of the state, rates among Hawaii County residents were approximately doubled for most of the age categories in the 5 through 39 year age range.  Rates were more comparable across the two locales for the older victims (ages 60 and over).  
 Hawaii County residents 
comprised 3032 of the victims killed in car crashes, 25% killed in motorcycle crashes, and 21% of those who drowned, although only 14% of the state popu -
lation resided on the island of Hawaii over the 5-year period.  These county disparities will be more fully examined in subsequent chapters. Figure 25. Number and rate of fatal unintentional injuries in Hawaii,

39 There were relatively few neighborhoods within Honolulu and Maui counties with “high” unintentional injury fa -
tality rates (Figure 20), although the 4 highest rates were computed for Neighborhood Boards on Oahu: Waikiki, Waianae, 
North Shore, and Nuuanu/Punchbowl.  the North Shore and Waianae had the 3rd and 4th highest rates in the state, respec -
tively.  Most of central Oahu had “low” fatality rates (shown by green shading in Figure 27), while eastern Oahu had areas mostly in the “medium” or “high” rate categories (lower map on Figure 27).

Unintentional Injuries Among Hawaii Residents
40 Residents for the most urbanized parts (North Kona and South Hilo) of the island of Hawaii were at the a higher 
risk of fatal unintentional injuries than residents of other areas of the County (Figure 28).  Kau residents also had a high 
rate, but it was based on only 19 deaths over the 5-year period.  Other “high” risk districts on the Neighbor Islands were Lihue and Koloa districts on Kauai.  The island of Molokai had a high rate (218 deaths/100,000 residents), but this was based on only 16 deaths.  There were only 2 deaths among residents of Lanai.  (Molokai and Lanai are not depicted on the Figure.)

ferences in the rates of fatal unin-
tentional injuries among the 8 main ethnicities residing in Hawaii (Figure 29).  (These 8 ethnicities represented 91% (1975) of the 2159 total deaths from unintentional injuries.)  Hawai-ian and Japanese residents had the highest rates, significantly higher than rates for African-American, Chinese, Filipino and Samoan residents.  Rates for Japanese residents were also sig-nificantly higher than those for Cauca -
sian and Korean residents.    Chinese residents had the lowest rates, sig -
nificantly lower than any group with a rate higher than 100 deaths/100,000.  The rates among African-Americans, Filipinos, Koreans, and Samoans were all statistically comparable. 
 Fatal unintentional injury 
rates were computed for different age groups within the 4 ethnicities in which there were at least 290 deaths (Figure 30).  For all 4 ethnicities, the rates were lowest for  the youngest residents (0 to 14 years), and then rose sharply after age 65.  However, the shape of that overall rise varied be -
tween ethnicities.  Hawaiians had the highest rates in all age groups between 15 and 64 years, significantly so for the 15 to 29 year age group.  Japanese residents had the highest rates in the senior age range, significantly higher than any other ethnic group.     Figure 29: Unadjusted rates (/100,000) of fatal

by category and ethnicity, 2007-2011.    Further analyses examined ethnic-
specific rates for the leading uninten -
tional categories of drowning, falls, motor vehicle occupant, and poison -
ing.  These categories accounted for 70% (1,216) of the 1,743 fatal unin-tentional injuries among these 4 eth-nicities.  Figure 31 shows that much of the excess risk among Hawaiian residents is due to higher rates of death among motor vehicle occupants and poisonings, while much of the ex -
cess among Japanese residents is due to fatal falls (predominantly among victims aged 65 years or older).  The drowning rates were generally compa -
rable across the 4 ethnicities, although the rate for Filipinos was significant-ly lower than those for Caucasians or Hawaiians.   The poisoning rates among Caucasian and Hawaiian resi -
dents were significantly higher than those for the other 2 ethnicities. 
Nonfatal injuries
 Falls were by far the leading 
cause of nonfatal unintentional inju -
ries, accounting for more than half of those that required hospitalization, and about one-third of those treated in EDs (Figure 32).  About three-quarters (78%) of the injury-related hospitalizations were caused by either falls (58%) or motor vehicle crashes (20%), most commonly injuries to au-tomobile occupants (9%).  The causes of injuries that were treated in EDs were more evenly distributed, includ -
ing proportionally fewer injuries from falls and motor vehicle crashes, and more injuries from being struck by objects or persons, overexertion, cut -
ting and piercing injuries, and natural and environmental causes.  Drowning and suffocation comprised negligible amounts of unintentional injuries at either level of medical care, although they were important causes of fatal in -
juries (see Figure 23).  Unintentional injuries from fires, machinery and firearms were also relatively rare in either medical setting.  Figure 32. Causes of nonfatal unintentional injuries among 
Hawaii residents, by level of medical care, 2007-2011.
(Percent of injuries by cause, average annual number listed in parenthesis.)   Unintentional Injuries Among Hawaii Residents
43 Table 4 lists the cause and average annual number of nonfatal unintentional injuries for each county of residence.  
The distribution of causes was generally similar across counties, with only a few exceptions.  Proportionally more (60%) 
of injury-related hospitalizations among Honolulu County residents were due to falls compared to the other counties (51% to 54%), while automobile crashes were a less common cause among Honolulu County  residents (8%, vs. 13% to 16% for other counties).  Automobile crashes caused a larger proportion of injuries treated in EDs among Hawaii County residents (9%) than the other counties (around 6%).

(Count ies w ith the same supersc ripted letter hav e statistically compa rable rate estimates.)  (Counties with the same superscripted letter have statistically comparable estimates.)     The rate for nonfatal unintentional 
injuries treated in EDs (519 inju-ries/10,000 residents) was 16 times higher overall than rates for injuries requiring hospitalization (32/10,000) (Figure 33).  This ratio varied over the age range, however, with the high-est disparities for residents under age 15 (approximately 40-to-1 ratio), and lowest among those aged 85 years and older (2.7-to-1).  Rates for ED visits were highest for young residents (un -
der 20 years of age) and those 85 years and older, and were progressively lower for the intervening age groups.  The pattern was different for injuries requiring hospitalizations, with low-est rates for residents under 15 years of age, followed by a peak for 15 to 24 year-olds, and a much higher peak among senior aged residents. Figure 33. Average annual rates (per 10,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for nonfatal unintentional 
injuries in Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 Residents of Kauai and Ha -
waii counties had the highest rates of unintentional injuries that were treat -
ed in EDs, approximately double the rates for Honolulu and Maui county residents (Figure 34).   The rates for injuries requiring hospitalizations were more comparable across counties, al -
though the rate for residents of Hono -
lulu County was significantly lower than rates for residents of the other 3 counties.  Figure 34. Age adjusted annual rates of nonfatal unintentional injuries,

crashes in Hawaii, by person type, 2007-2011: Differ -
ences in per capita rates (left side) and rates based on 
person trips (right side).Fatal injuries
 Deaths from motor vehicle crashes are catego -
rized into 4 main types: those among the occupants of 
automobiles, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians.  There is a separate chapter for each of these categories, since the demographics and risk factors are different for each.  Figure 35 shows that half (50%, or 290) of the 581 residents who died in motor vehicle crashes were car occupants.  About one-fifth (22%, or 146) were pe -
destrians, 25% were riding motorcycles or mopeds, and the remaining 3% were bicyclists. 
 If fatality rates are computed the usual way, per 
resident population, then rates will resemble the distribu -
tion of fatalities shown in Figure 35, i.e. the fatality rate for occupants is about 2 times that for motorcyclists or pedestrians; the same ratio as the number of decedents for each type of crash.  This is because the denomina-tor used for this type of rate (resident population) is the same for each type of decedent; differences in rates are only dependent on differences in the numerator (number of deaths).  Using resident population as the numerator implies that every person is potentially a car occupant, motor -
cyclist, pedestrian or bicyclist.  This assumption is made because there is usually no alternative data to describe a person’s “exposure” that is consistent across modes of transportation.  We can not directly compare, for example, a fatality rate for pedestrians (adjusted for population, since most people actually are pedestrians) with a fatality rate for motorcyclists (adjusted for the number of registered motorcycles).  
  
 Data from the National Household Travel Survey 
does provide common measures of exposure for different modes of travel.  The NHTS was last conducted in 2009, and included data from 456 Hawaii residents from 228 households.  Respondents were asked to keep a travel di -
ary, from which the number of person trips were estimated for each mode of transportation.  According to this survey, most (85.4%) trips in Hawaii were completed by passen -
ger vehicle.  Pedestrians accounted for most of the remain -
ing trips (12.8%), followed by bicyclists (1.0%).  None of those surveyed reported trips by motorcycle, so the 2001 NHTS estimate of 0.4% is used for trips by motorcycle in the calculations below.  Figure 36 shows the relative differences in fatality rates when adjusted for population (left side of the graph) and number of person trips, using the NHTS data (right side).  Car occupants clearly had the highest fatality rates for a given population, more than double the rates for pedestrians and motorcyclists, and 18 times that for bicyclists.  Again, this is simply a reflection of the number of each type of fatality, as shown in Figure 35.  When adjusted for the estimated number of person trips, however, motorcyclists had by far the highest fatality rate, and car occupants the lowest rate.  For a given number of trips (1 million in this case), motorcyclists (26 deaths/million trips) were 123 times more likely to die in a crash compared to car occupants (0.21/million).  Bicyclists and pedestrians were also significantly more likely to have been killed for a given number of person trips, compared to Hawaii residents who traveled by car.  In summary, the NHTS exposure data suggests that travel by car is the safest mode in Hawaii, while motorcyclists are at the greatest risk for a given number of trips, followed by bicyclists and pedestrians.

 Motor vehicle crashes were 
the 3rd most frequent type of unin -
tentional injury death in Hawaii, with 
290 occupant fatalities over the 5-year period.  There was a decreasing trend in the annual number of such deaths, from 69 in 2007 to 48 in 2011 (Figure 37).  The 290 victims were killed in 268 separate crashes, as 249 (93%) of the crashes involved only a single fatality.  There were 16 crashes with 2 victims each, and 3 crashes with 3 victims each.  The 290 fatalities in-clude 4 drivers of all terrain vehicles (ATVs), who are nonetheless techni -
cally considered “occupants”.  All of these ATV-related deaths occurred in Hawaii County, and there was one death each year from 2008 to 2011.
 Only 40% of the victims were injured in Honolulu County .  Nearly one-third (94, or 32%) were killed in Hawaii 
County, which is notable since only 14% of the  population of the state resides in this county.  Maui and Kauai counties accounted for 16% and 12% of the victims, respectively.  All but 4 of the 46 people who were killed in Maui County were injured on the island of Maui; there were 4 deaths on the island of Molokai.Figure 37.  Annual number of fatally injured car occupants
 in Hawaii, by county, 2007-2011.
Figure 38. Age and gender distribution of fatally injured 
car occupants in Hawaii, 2007-2011.
 The age distribution (Figure 
38) showed a peak of fatalities in the 15 to 24 year age group.  Almost one-third (91, or 32%) of the 328 victims were in this age range.  Another 33% (96) of the victims were 25 to 44 years of age.  Very few (13, or 4%) of the victims were under 16 years of age.   Male victims (213) outnumbered fe-males (77) by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio.  The graph also shows that ratio was lower in the very young and very old age groups. Motor Vehicle Occupants

Oahu  Although the highest number 
of victims were injured on Oahu, the 
rate of fatal car occupant injuries was much higher among Neighbor Island residents (Figure 39).  The rates for residents of Hawaii and Kauai coun -
ties were particularly high, nearly 4 times higher than that computed for Honolulu County.   The rate for resi-dents of Honolulu County was signifi -
cantly lower than any other county.  When considered as a whole, rates among Neighbor Island residents were more than 3 times higher than the rate for residents of Honolulu County.  The rates for Hawaii and Kauai coun-ties were statistically comparable, but significantly higher than the rate for residents of Maui County.  (Results were similar if county-specific esti -
mates for vehicle miles traveled were used as the rate denominator, instead of resident population.) Figure 39. Number and rate of fatal injuries 
among car occupants in Hawaii, by county of injury, 2007-2011.
(Rate is per 100,000 residents, age adjusted to the 2000 
U.S. population distribution.)
 Figure 40 shows that the 
pronounced rate differences between Neighbor Island residents and Oahu residents are evident in almost every age group.  The main exception is among victims younger than 15 years of age, where there were relatively few fatalities.  Rates for Neighbor Island residents were significantly greater than for Honolulu residents for almost every age group from 15 to 49 years.  The graph also shows the general pattern of car occupant fatali -
ty rates: very low before the age of 15, then rising sharply to a peak in the 20 to 24 year age groups, then gradually decreasing before another rise around 65 years of age.Figure 40. Five-year rates (/100,000) of fatal car occupant

22% of the total) and Sundays (53 crashes, 20%) were the most common days for fatal crashes.  (The crash date was not 
known for one victim.)  More than half of the crashes (57%, or 151 of 264 crashes for which information was available) occurred during nighttime hours (7:30 p.m. to 5:30 a.m.), and more than one-third (36%, or 94 crashes) occurred during the 5-hour period from 9:31 p.m. to 2:29 a.m.  
 Most (93%, or 223) of the 242 fatalities that occurred from 2007 through 2010 could be linked to FARS records, 
which contain information on the involvement of alcohol, seat belt use and other risk factors in the crash.  This data was available both for the crash decedents and other survivors involved in the crash.  The remainder of this chapter (excluding the maps) utilizes FARS data, and is therefore restricted to the 223 victims who died in 201 traffic crashes (i.e. those that occurred on public roadways).  These analyses also exclude 3 riders of ATVs, given the unique nature of those vehicles.  
 Lack of restraint use was a major risk factor for occupant fatalities, as less than half of the victims were wearing 
seat belts at the time of the crash: 47%, or 91 of the 193 victims for whom information was available.  Restraint use was lowest among back seat passengers (25%, or 3 of 12 victims.  Restrained victims were significantly older than unrestrained victims (average age: 43 vs. 30 years).  Seatbelt use was inversely associated with alcohol, as only 40% of the victims in alcohol-related crashes were restrained, compared to 59% of those in crashes not involving alcohol.  This association was stronger among drivers, as only 37% of the fatally injured drivers who had been drinking were restrained, compared to 66% of the drivers who had not been drinking. 
 More than half (61%, or 123) of the 201 fatal crashes involved only a single vehicle, and were likely related to 
the driver losing control of the car.  There was no trend in the annual proportion of fatal crashes that involved only a single vehicle.  Single vehicle crashes were slightly more likely to involve alcohol positive drivers than were crashes involving 2 or more cars (61% vs. 55%), although this was not a statistically significant dif ference. 
 Among the 288 drivers involved in the fatal traffic crashes, the most common contributing factor was speeding, 
which was noted for 41% (119) of the drivers (Figure 41).  There was no clear trend in the annual proportion of drivers who were speeding, which varied from 35% to 48%.  Drivers who were speeding were significantly more likely to have a fatal injury (72%) compared to drivers who were not speeding (49%), partly because the former were much less likely to have been using seat belts (31% vs. 80%, respectively).  Speeding was more common among drivers who crashed on Oahu (47%) or the island of Hawaii (48%), compared to those who crashed in Kauai (26%) or Maui counties (25%).  Sixteen-percent of drivers crashed after failure to keep in the proper lane (20%), and 8% were described as inattentive or distracted.

Alcohol Drugs Alcohol and/or drugs positi ve negative  not tested  unknown   Forty percent of the 288 
drivers involved in fatal car crashes 
tested positive for alcohol, and near -
ly one-fourth (23%) tested positive for drugs (Figure 42).  Considered together, almost half (49%) of driv -
ers tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Most (89%, or 101 of 114) of the drivers who tested positive for alcohol had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater, including 66 drivers (58%) who had BAC levels of 0.16% or greater.  There was no consistent trend in the annual proportion of drivers who were drinking, although this was highest in 2009 (52%), and lowest in 2010 (30%).  There was no trend in the proportion of drivers who tested positive for drugs.  The most com-monly occurring drugs were THC (42 drivers) and stimulants (28 driv -
ers), principally methamphetamine (12 drivers), amphetamine (6 drivers), and cocaine (13 drivers).  Figure 42. Alcohol and/or drug use (percent) among car drivers involved 
in fatal car crashes in Hawaii, 2007-2010.
 The peak age of alcohol use 
among drivers was 21 to 24 years of age, as 56% (29 of 52) tested posi -
tive for alcohol (Figure 43).  Alco-hol use progressively decreased with increasing driver age after this peak, being lowest among senior aged driv -
ers (4%).  Underage drinking was highly prevalent in Hawaii, as nearly half (48%, or 20 of 42) of the driv -
ers under 21 years of age had been drinking.  There was also an associa-tion between driver age and positive drug tests, as the proportion generally decreased from 36% among drivers under 21 years of age to 14% among senior-aged drivers.  Figure 43. Alcohol and drug use (percent) among car drivers involved in 
fatal car crashes in Hawaii, by age of driver, 2007-2010.Motor Vehicle Occupants
51 Drivers who tested positive for alcohol and/or drugs were significantly different in a number of ways than drivers 
who were negative or not tested (Table 5).  They were significantly younger overall, and more likely to be in the 21 to 34 
year peak age range.  Substance positive drivers were 3 times more likely to have not been using seat belts at the time of the crash, and 3 times more likely to have been speeding.  These behaviors contributed to significantly elevated fatality rates among substance using drivers compared to other drivers.  Drivers who tested positive for alcohol or drugs were also significantly more likely to have had an invalid license at the time of the crash.   
 There were few significant differences between drivers who tested negative for both alcohol and drugs, and driv -
ers who were not tested for either substance.  Apart from fatality rate (almost all (98%) fatally injured occupants are tested) the only exception was tested drivers were significantly more likely to have been in a weekend crash (40%), compared to untested drivers (21%), and less likely to have been in a night time crash (29%, vs. 50% of untested drivers).   These find -
ings support the assumption that there was little probable cause for testing among drivers who were not tested and they can therefore be considered to have the same sobriety status as drivers who actually tested negative.

Alcohol-related 
(Four -year t otal: 56%)  Alcohol/drug-related 
(4-year t otal: 67%)  (Four-year total: 56%) (4-year total: 67%) More than half (56%, or 124) of the 223 occupant fatalities were related to alcohol consumption among at least 
one driver (left side of Figure 44).  (All of the statistics in this section include crashes for which the alcohol status was 
unknown.)  There was no consistent annual trend in this proportion, which varied from 47% to 71%.  Each year there was an average of 31 resident occupants killed in alcohol-related crashes.  Alcohol involvement was greater when only night -
time (those occurring between 7:31 pm and 5:29 am) crashes are considered: 75% (101) of the 134 fatalities were alcohol-related.  The proportion of alcohol-related fatalities was highest for crashes on Hawaii (69%) and Kauai counties (64%) and lowest for crashes on Honolulu (45%) and Maui counties (49%).  
 If drugs were also considered, 67% of occupant fatalities were related to drivers who tested positive for either 
alcohol or drugs (right side of Figure 44).  This proportion peaked in 2009 at 73%.  Most of the occupants killed in Hawaii (84%, or 59 of 70) or Kauai counties (79%, or 22 of 28) were in alcohol/drug-related crashes.  (This proportion was 52% for Honolulu County and 59% for Maui County.)  Alcohol/drug-related crashes accounted for almost all (81%, or 108 of 134) of the occupants killed in nighttime crashes.

cupant fatalities by district.  The alcohol status for the crash is color coded, although this was not available for 67 (25%) 
of the 266 crashes.  The districts with the 5 highest fatality totals were North Kona (22 deaths) and Puna (14) in Hawaii County, Waianae (14) on Oahu, and Wailuku (20) and Makawao (15) on Maui.  All of the 9 districts on Hawaii had at least 4 deaths, including 5 districts with 11 or more deaths.  Only about one-quarter (27%, or 28) of the 103 fatal crashes on Oahu were on the eastern end of the island (Figure 45).

55Nonfatal injuries
 There were decreasing trends in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among automobile occupants, both for 
those treated in EDs or requiring hospitalization (Table 6).  Most (91%) of the injuries were treated in EDs.  Gender was 
nearly equally distributed (52% females, 48% males) overall, but males comprised 60% of those who were hospitalized.  Patient age was widely distributed, although more than one-quarter (27%) of those who were treated in EDs  or hospital-ized (28%) were in the 15 to 24 year age range.  Relatively few were younger than 15 (7%) or older than 65 years of age (10%).  Slightly more than half (56%) of the patients were residents of Oahu, although 70% of the state’s population re -
sided on that island.  In contrast, 25% of the patients were residents of Hawaii County, which comprised only 14% of the population.

was among 15 to 24 year-old residents (Figure 47).  For either type of injury the lowest rates were found for resi -
dents under 15 years of age, with low -
est rates among those under 5 years.  Rates of ED visits declined progres-sively from the peak among 15 to 19 year-olds, while hospitalizations gen -
erally declined over the 25 to 64 year age range, before increasing among older age groups. Figure 47. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of

Rates of ED visits among residents of Hawaii and Kauai counties were ap-proximately double the rate for Hono-lulu County residents.  Residents of Honolulu County also had the lowest rates of hospitalizations, significantly lower than any other county.  Hospi -

57 Almost all (95%) of the injuries were coded as “traffic”, or occurring on public roads.  The proportion of injuries 
from non-traffic crashes (those on private roads, driveways and parking lots) was nearly twice as high among patients from 
Neighbor Islands (7%) compared to those from Oahu (4%).  Three-quarters (75%) of the injuries resulted from collisions with other vehicles (68%) or other objects such as abutments or traffic signs (7%).  One-fifth (20%) of the crashes did not involve collisions with other vehicles or objects on the roadway, but were due to loss of control in a single vehicle crash.  (Collision status of the crash was unspecified for the remaining 5% of occupants.)  Hospitalized patients were much more likely to have been injured in crashes that did not involve collisions on the roadway (40%) than were patients who were treated in EDs (18%).
 Patients were hospitalized for an average of nearly 1 week, with nearly $46,000 in average medical charges per 
patient (Table 7).  Hospitalizations comprised most of the annual total of $28.6 million in medical charges in the state.  The average ED visit resulted in over $2,300 in average medical charges.  Most (85%) of the hospitalized patients had internal injuries (32%) or fractures (53%), which were widely distributed throughout the body.  Patients who were treated in EDs were more likely to have less severe injuries such as sprains and strains (43%) or contusions and superficial injuries (29%).  The incidence of traumatic brain injury was also much higher among the hospitalized patients (37%) compared to those treated in EDs (14%).

all crash es serious o r worse inju ries not t ransporte d/minor  injuri es all crashes not transported/minor injuries serious or worse injuries There were 25,502 EMS records for Hawaii resi -

injuries over the 2007 to 2011 period.  (Records for 478 patients whose residence could not be determined were ex-cluded.)  To avoid double-counting of injuries, the records of 300 patients who were transferred to another ambulance were excluded, resulting in the final sample of 25,202 re -
cords.  Included in this total were 269 patients who ulti -
mately died from the crashes, since this is an important outcome to examine in terms of protective factors used by occupants.  (All but 5 (98%) of these 269 deaths were con -
firmed by linkage to death certificates.)   
 The 25,202 injuries resulted from an estimated 
18,520 separate crashes.  Three-fourths (75%, or 13,961) of the crashes had only a single injured occupant, 17% had 2 injuries, 5% had 3, and the remaining 3% of crashes had 4 or more injured occupants.  Figure 49 shows a wide temporal distribution of these crashes, although there was a peak (19%, or 3440, of crashes) in the 3-hour period from 2:31 p.m. to 5:29 p.m.  Most (72%, or 13,398) of the

Vertical scale indicates percent of all crashes with injured occupants, rounded to nearest whole number.)crashes occurred during daytime hours (5:29 a.m to 7:30 p.m.).  That proportion was higher for crashes that did not require patient transport to hospitals or only the transport of patients with injuries of “minor” severity (76%, or 9407 of 15,822), compared to 66% (3,991) of the 9,380 crashes that involved “serious” or worse injuries.  Fourteen-per -
cent (870) of the latter type of crashes occurred between 11:31 p.m. and 3:29 a.m.  
 Fridays (15%, or 2770 crashes) and Saturdays 
(16%, or 2915) were the most common days of the week for crashes (14% for all other days).  Crashes on weekends were more likely to occur during nighttime hours (37%), compared to crashes during the week (24%).  One-fifth (20%, or 2634 of 13,034 crashes) of the weekday crashes occurred during the 3-hour period from 2:31 p.m. to 5:29 p.m., compared to 15% (806) of the 5486 crashes on week -
ends.  Motor Vehicle Occupants
59 Figures 50 and 51 show the approximate locations of EMS-attended crashes within each county.  The western and 
central portions of Oahu had the highest frequencies of crashes, although Kalihi-Palama had the highest total (841 crashes) 
among the 35 Neighborhood Boards.  Most of the other central Honolulu areas had medium or lower totals.  About half (51%) of the crashes in Hawaii County occurred in either the Hilo or North Kona districts.  There was also a high total in the Puna district.  About half (52%) of the crashes on the island of Maui were in the Wailuku district.  There were also 88 crashes on the island of Molokai and 17 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

 minor/mo derate serious  died  minor/moderate About one-third (35%, or 8700) of the occupants refused EMS transport to hospitals and requested their release 
at the scene of the crash (Figure 52).  A roughly equal number of patients (36%, or 8993) were transported with injuries 
that were characterized as “minor” or “moderate” by paramedics, and 27% were transported with “serious” injuries.  There were 274 patients transported in “critical” condition, and another 269 who ultimately died.  (The latter status included those described as deceased on the scene as well as those linked to death certificates after they were transported to hospitals.)  
 
 Patient condition differed by the restraint status of the occupants.  Compared to restrained occupants, unrestrained 
occupants were more likely to have been transported with serious or critical injuries and less likely to have been released at the scene or transported with minor or moderate injuries.  (All comparisons were statistically significant.)  The mortal -
ity rate among unrestrained occupants (4.5%, or 116 deaths among 2585 occupants) was 7 times higher than the rate for restrained occupants (0.6%, or 97 of 15308).  Use of occupant restraints was not clearly coded for 29% (7309) of these patients.  The injury distribution of this group resembled that of restrained occupants more than unrestrained occupants, including a statistically comparable fatality rate with the former.  This group was statistically comparable to restrained occupants in average age, probably alcohol use, and the proportion involved in night time crashes, whereas unrestrained occupants had significantly different distribution of all these variables, compared to restrained occupants.

by EMS personnel, by seat belt usage, 2007-2011.
*Not shown are 108 patients who were transported with injuries of unknown severity .62 Motor Vehicle Occupants Probable alcohol use was noted for about 10% of the patients, as EMS personnel documented physical evidence 
(e.g. containers) at the crash scene, alcohol odor on the patients’ breath, or the patient admitted to alcohol consumption 
(Table 8).  Alcohol users were significantly younger than occupants who did not use alcohol or for whom this status was unknown.  They were also more likely to be males, less likely to use restraints, and more likely to have been in a night time crash or a crash on the weekend.  There were also significant differences in the disposition of patients, as those who had used alcohol were twice as likely to have had serious or critical injuries as other occupants, and had 5 times greater fatality rates.

certificates, DOT reports, and hospital records.  Since the main focus is on the mitigation of injuries by restraint usage, 
records for 56 patients who were seated in cargo areas or truck beds were excluded from these analyses.  About three-fourths (72%, or 3895) of the 5813 remaining EMS records for injured Hawaii residents were probabilistically linked to DOT records.  That proportion was highest for crashes in Hawaii (79%) and Kauai counties (77%), lowest for Maui County (63%), and intermediate for crashes on Oahu (71%).  There were no significant differences in patient age or gender between linked and unlinked records.  Hospital records were deterministically linked to 83% (2943) of the 3556 patients who were transported to hospitals by EMS.  Hospital records were also linked to 311 additional EMS patients who refused EMS transport but apparently took private vehicles to hospitals.  
 Most (84%) of the occupants were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash, 15% were unrestrained, and the 
status was unknown for the remaining 1% (Figure 53).  Only 75% of occupants who were injured in Maui County were restrained, a significantly lower proportion than for occupants injured in any other county (83% to 86%).  Restraint use was significantly lower among back seat passengers (78%), compared to drivers or front seat passengers (90%).  These disparities were apparent across all counties and both genders.  Restraint use among back seat passenger who were under 18 years of age (87%) was significantly higher than among older passengers (68%), possibly because it is legally required among the former.

half (51%) were discharged from the ED, 8% were hospitalized, and 1% (61) ultimately died from their injuries (Figure 
54).  The remaining 11% were transported by EMS, but could not be linked to hospital records.  Paramedic characterization of injury severity for these patients (66% with “minor” injuries, 34% with “serious” or worse) was very similar to that of patients whose medical records showed a discharge from ED (68% with “minor” injuries, 32% with “serious” or worse).  In contrast, most (88%) of the patients who were eventually hospitalized or who died from their injuries had “serious” or worse injuries, as graded by paramedics.  
 The final medical dispositions of the occupants was strongly associated with restraint usage as the proportion of 
unrestrained occupants who were hospitalized was nearly twice as high as among restrained occupants (13% vs. 7%), and mortality rates were 3 times among the former (2.6% vs. 0.8%).  
 Average medical charges were significantly higher, by 36%, among unrestrained occupants who were discharged 
from the ED ($3,809), compared to restrained occupants ($2791).  There was no difference in the average charges for hospitalizations between the two groups ($54,738 and $53,040, respectively).  The average length of each hospitalization was somewhat longer among unrestrained occupants (7.3 days, vs. 6.8 for restrained occupants), but not to a statistically significant degree.

65 Unrestrained occupants had more than twice the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in 
death, compared to restrained occupants (Table 9).  The elevated odds were also evident after statistical adjustment for oc -
cupant age, gender, and the county in which the crash occurred.  The odds of a fatal injury were more than 3 times higher 
among unrestrained passengers, independent of the other demographic and geographic cofactors.

 About one-third of the injured resident occupants in the HTR tested positive for alcohol (32%) or illicit drugs 
(35%) (Figure 55).  These proportions were similar between patients who were drivers and those who were passengers.   
Considered together, more than half (52%, or 626) of the occupants  tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Most (84%, or 240) of the 286 drivers who tested positive for alcohol had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater, including 176 drivers (62%) who had BAC levels of 0.16% or greater.  The most commonly occurring drugs were narcotics (18% of patients), THC (17%), amphetamines (8%), and cocaine (4%).  
 
 Occupants who were drinking were significantly younger than those who tested negative for alcohol (32 vs. 41 
years, on average), more likely to be male (75% vs. 56%), and less likely to have used seat belts (46% vs. 63%).  Drinkers were also significantly more likely to have crashed on a weekend (47% vs. 33% of those who tested negative), or during night time hours (73% vs. 29%, respectively).  There were no significant differences in the mortality rate or the likelihood of a discharge to a rehabilitation facility between occupants who tested positive and negative for alcohol.

 Deaths among motorcyclists 
were the 6th leading cause of fatal 
unintentional injuries in the state, ac -
counting for 146 total deaths from 2007 to 2011.  Figure 56 shows there were anywhere from 23 to 37 such fatalities each year, with no apparent trend in the annual number.  The 146 fatalities resulted from 144 crashes, as only 2 crashes involved more than 1 victim.  Only 5 of the victims were passengers; the rest were drivers of the motorcycle or moped. One-quar -
ter (25%, or 37) of the victims were killed in Hawaii County, although only 14% of the population resides there and only 14% of all motorcycles are registered in this county.  More than half (53%, or 77) were killed on the island of Oahu, and only 7 died on Kauai over the 5-year period.Figure 56.  Annual number of fatally injured motorcyclists
 in Hawaii, by county, 2007-2011.
 Eighteen percent (27) of the 
146 victims were killed while riding a moped (Figure 57).  Most (20, or 74%) of the moped riders were killed on Oahu, which had the highest pro -
portion of victims who were moped riders (26%, vs. 10% for the rest of the state).  The number of fatally in -
jured moped riders increased from 3 in 2007 to 8 in both 2010 and 2011.  
 Only about one-fourth (27%, 
or 40) of the decedents were wear -
ing a helmet at the time of the crash.  This proportion did not change over time or across counties, but was much lower among moped riders (7%, or 2 of 27), compared to motorcycle riders (32%, or 38 of 119).  Figure 57.  Annual number of fatally injured motorcyclists,

ure 58).  Only 8 of the victims were younger than 18 years of age.  The peak age was 20 to 34 years, which included 41% 
(60) of the victims.  The age distributions were similar between moped and motorcycle riders.  Only 9 (6%) of the victims were females, including the 4 of the 5 victims who were passengers.  
Figure 58. Age distribution of fatally injured motorcyclists in Hawaii,by vehicle type, 2007-2011.
 There was no noticeable seasonality in terms of 
the month of the year for the 144 crashes.  Saturdays (24 crashes, 17% of the total) and Sundays (34 crashes) were the most common days for fatal crashes.  Nearly half (43%, or 62) of the 144 crashes occurred during nighttime hours (7:30 p.m. to 5:29 a.m), including 51 (35%) during the 6-hour period of from 7:30 p.m. to 1:29 a.m.  
 Most (93%, or 110) of the 118 fatalities from 2007 
through 2010 could be linked to FARS records, which con -
tain information on the involvement of alcohol, helmet use and other risk factors in the crash.  This data was available both for the crash decedents and other survivors involved in the crash.  The remainder of this chapter (excluding the maps) utilizes FARS data, and is therefore restricted to the 110 victims who died in traffic crashes (i.e. those that oc -
curred on public roadways).   Almost half (46%, or 50) of the 108 crashes in -
volved only a single moped or motorcycle, and were like -
ly related to the driver losing control of the motorcycle.  The proportion of single vehicle crashes was lower (26%) among the 19 crashes involving mopeds, and 51% for the 89 crashes involving motorcycles.Motorcyclists

Alcohol Drugs Alcohol and/or drugs 
positi ve negative  not tested  unknown  positiveFigure 59.  Contributing factors among drivers involved in fatal 
motorcycle/moped traffic crashes in Hawaii, by crash type, 2007-2010. There were 174 drivers in -
volved in the 108 fatal crashes, in-
cluding 99 motorcycle drivers, 16 moped riders, 57 car/truck drivers, and 2 drivers of unknown types of ve -
hicles.  Speeding was the most com -
mon contributing factor among all drivers (17%, or 29 drivers), or driv-ers of either type of crash (Figure 59).  Failure to yield the right-of-way or to obey traffic signs or controls was also a common factor among drivers of both types of crashes.  Reckless/ag-gressive driving was a common fac-tor among drivers involved in fatal motorcyclist crashes (15%), while in-attentive/distracted driving was more common among those involved in moped crashes (16%).  
 Three-fourths (76%, or 38) of the 50 single vehicle crashes involved speeding.  Drivers who were speeding were 
significantly younger than those who were not (35 vs. 40 years), and more likely to have been in a nighttime crash (56%, vs. 33% of those who were not speeding).  .  Most (68%) of the 57 crashes on Oahu involved a speeding driver; speeding was a less commonly noted factor in Neighbor Islands crashes (47%, or 24 of 51).  
 One-third of the 174 drivers 
involved in fatal motorcyclist crashes tested positive for alcohol, and more than one-fifth (22%) tested positive for drugs (Figure 60).  Nearly one-half (45%) of the drivers were posi -
tive for either alcohol or drugs.  Most (82%, or 47 of 57) of the drivers who tested positive for alcohol had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater, and 56% (32 drivers) had BAC levels of 0.16% or greater.  There was an increasing trend in the annual proportion of drivers who were drinking, from 30% in 2007 to 36% in 2010.  Drivers in -
volved in crashes on Hawaii County were most likely to have been drink -
ing (42%, vs. 29% to 30% for other counties).  There was no trend in the proportion of drivers who tested positive for drugs, although this was highest in 2010 (38%, vs. 17% to 18% in earlier years).  The most com -
monly occurring drugs were THC (25 drivers) and stimulants (11 drivers), principally methamphetamine (7 drivers).  Figure 60. Alcohol and/or drug use (percent) among drivers involved in 
fatal motorcycle crashes in Hawaii, 2007-2010.Motorcyclists
70 Motorcycle and moped drivers who tested positive for alcohol were significantly more likely to have been speed -
ing, in a single vehicle crash, or been in a nighttime crash, compared to drivers who either tested negative for alcohol or 
drugs or who were untested (Table 10).  Alcohol positive drivers were also significantly more likely to have had a previous DUI, a previously suspended license, and less likely to have had a valid motorcycle driver license.  Drug positive drivers were also significantly more likely to have had a previous DUI or to have not had a valid license.
 Overall, only 49% (52) of the 106 fatally injured motorcycle or moped drivers had a valid motorcycle drivers 
license at the time of the crash.  That proportion was lower among the moped drivers (33%, or 5 of 15), compared to the motorcycle drivers (52%, or 47 of 91), although not to a statistically significant degree.  Among the 54 drivers with invalid licenses, about half (52%, or 28) had a general drivers license, but not specific to operating a motorcycle.  Another 14 (26%) had licenses that were suspended or revoked, 3 (6%) had expired, and 8 (15%) had no license at all.

(Four-year total: 48%) (4-year total: 66%) Nearly half (48%, or 53) of the 110 decedents died in alcohol-related crashes (Figure 61).  There was somewhat 
of a decreasing trend in the proportion of fatal motorcycle crashes that involved alcohol over the 2007 to 2009 period, but a 
subsequent increase to 52% in 2010.  Most (92%, or 48) of the 52 crashes that were alcohol related involved drinking only on the part of the fatally injured motorcycle driver.  (Or the motorcycle driver in the case of 1 fatally injured passenger.)  Another 4 crashes involved drinking on the part of both the motorcyclists and drivers of other motor vehicles.  Only 2 of the crashes involved drinking on the part of the car driver and not the motorcycle driver.  The proportion of alcohol-related fatalities was highest for crashes in Hawaii County (57%).  Alcohol was involved in 69% of the 51 crashes that occurred during nighttime (between 7:31 pm and 5:29 am).  
   If drugs were also considered, two-thirds (66%) of all fatal crashes were related to drivers who tested positive for 
either alcohol or drugs.  This proportion increased to 84% in 2010, due mostly to crashes in Honolulu County, 12 of 13 of which were related to substance use among drivers.  Nearly all (86%, or 44) of the 51 nighttime crashes involved substance use by at least one driver in the crash

among motorcycle  and moped riders in Hawaii, 2007-2010.Motorcyclists
72 Figures 62 and 63 show the approximate geographic location of the fatal motorcycle crashes.  There were 13 
deaths in the North Shore district, and 7 in both the Kailua and Waipahu districts (Figure 62).  On Maui there were 17 
deaths in the Wailuku district, and 5 in Makawao (Figure 63).  There were also high numbers of deaths in the Hawaii County districts of North Kona (12), Puna (10) and South Hilo (6).  The fatal moped crashes were widely distributed; South Hilo had the highest total (3 deaths).

74Nonfatal injuries
 There was an decreasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among both motorcyclists treated in EDs 
and those admitted to hospitals over the 2007-2010 period, but increases in 2011 (Table 11).  Hospitalizations comprised 
about one-fifth (21%) of the nonfatal injuries to motorcyclists.  Most (83%) of the patients were males, and this distribution was consistent across counties.  Patient age was narrowly distributed, as about half (51%) were 15 to 34 years of age, and most (82%) were between 15 and 54 years of age.  About half (54%) of the patients were residents of Oahu.  Almost all (94%) of the patients were motorcycle drivers; only 6% were passengers.

both ED visits and hospitalizations 
was among 15 to 29 year-old resi -
dents, particularly 20 to 24 year-olds (Figure 64).  Rates of either type of injury declined steadily from the 20 to 24 year-old peak, more sharply in the case of ED visits. Figure 64. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for nonfatal injuries from 
motorcycle crashes in Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 The rate of ED visits for 
residents of Honolulu County was significantly lower, by at least 2 times, than the rate for residents of any other county (Figure 65).  Rates were statistically comparable among the other 3 counties.   A similar pat -
tern was seen for hospitalization rates, although there was no significant dif-ference between the rates for Kauai and Honolulu residents.  The highest rate of hospitalizations was computed for Maui County residents, although they were statistically comparable to the rates for residents of Hawaii and Kauai counties.    Figure 65.

motor vehicle (39%).  Forty-four percent of the crashes did not involve a collision, but were due to loss of control by the 
rider.  (This status was not known for the remaining 10% of crashes.)  The distribution of crash type was similar for injuries 
treated in EDs and those that required hospitalization.    
 Three-fourths (75%) of the nonfatal injuries were coded as “traffic” related, or occurring on a public roadway, 
while 25% were in “non-traffic” environments, including private roads, driveways and parking lots (Figure 66).  The pro -
portion of traffic crashes varied by the county of residence of the patients, being highest for residents of Honolulu (81%) and Maui (76%) counties, and lowest for residents of Hawaii (68%) and Kauai (55%) counties.  Injuries that required hospitalization were significantly more likely to be from traffic crashes, compared to those that were treated in EDs (89% vs. 72%, respectively).  Patients who were injured from non-traffic crashes were significantly younger on average than those involved in traffic crashes (28 vs. 35 years, respectively).  Nearly one-fifth (19%) of the patients who were injured in non-traffic crashes were 5 to 14 years of age, compared to only 3% of those who were injured in traffic crashes.

77 Because patients were hospitalized for an average of 1 week, the total number of days of care was greater for hos -
pitalizations than ED visits (Table 12).  Hospitalizations also comprised most (85%) of the annual total of $16.7 million in 
medical charges in the state.  The average hospitalization resulted in over $51,000 in medical charges, compared to about $2,700 for each ED visit.  
 Nearly two-thirds (64%) of the hospitalized patients and one-quarter (23%) of those treated in EDs had fractures, 
most commonly in the lower leg or foot, although fractures were widely distributed among areas of the body.  Internal injuries were also prevalent (24%) among hospitalized patients, while open wounds (15%) and contusions and superficial injuries (31%) were more common among those treated in EDs.  One-fifth (21%) of the patients had a traumatic brain injury, including 39% of those who were hospitalized.

all crash es serious o r worse inju ries not t ransporte d/minor  injuri es all crashes not transported/minor injuries serious or worse injuries There were 3,724 EMS records for Hawaii residents who were treated by EMS personnel for injuries from mo -
torcycle and moped crashes over the 5-year period.  (Records for 79 patients whose residence could not be determined 
were excluded.)  An additional 52 records of patients who were transferred to another ambulance were also excluded, to avoid double-counting.  The final sample was 3,593 records.  This total includes 128 patients who ultimately died from the crashes, since this is an important outcome to examine in terms of helmet usage by riders.  (All deaths were confirmed by linkage to death certificates.)  
 The 3,593 injuries resulted from an estimated 3,444 separate crashes, as most (96%) of the crashes involved only 
a single injury.  Figure 67 shows a broad peak in the time of the crashes from 9:31 a.m. to 7:29 p.m. (63% of crashes).  Crashes with no patient transports or only minor/moderate injuries were somewhat more likely to occur daytime hours (5:29 a.m to 7:30 p.m.), compared to crashes which resulted in “serious” or worse injuries (79% vs. 72%, respectively).  Fifteen-percent (274) of the latter type of crashes occurred between 7:31 p.m. and 2:29 a.m. 
 Sundays (20%, or 710 crashes) and Saturdays (17%, or 614) were by far the most common days of the week for 
crashes (12% to 14% for all other days); more than one-third (37%, or 1324) of the crashes occurred on weekends.  There were no large difference in the time distribution between weekend and weekday crashes, although 13% of the latter oc -
curred during the morning rush hour period of 7:31 a.m. to 9:29 a.m., compared to only 7% of the weekend crashes.  One-fifth (20%, or 2634 of 13,034 crashes) of the weekday crashes occurred during the 3-hour period from 2:31 p.m. to 5:29 p.m., compared to 15% (806) of the 5486 crashes on weekends.

79 Four of the 5 highest crash locations on Oahu were in the metropolitan Honolulu area, from Kalihi-Palama to 
Waikiki (Figure 68).  Two-thirds (68%) of the 519 crashes in Hawaii County were in North Kona (46%) or South Hilo 
(21%) (Figure 69).  The Wailuku and Lahaina districts accounted for most (78%) of the crashes on the island of Maui.  There were also 13 crashes on the island of Molokai and 4 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

of the riders refused EMS transport

ed with only “minor” or “moderate” injuries (22%) (Figure 70).  Another 46% (1670) were transported with “serious” injuries, 107 in “critical” condition, and another 128 who ul-timately died.  (The latter status in-cluded those described as deceased on the scene as well as those linked to death certificates after they were transported to hospitals.)  
 Patient condition differed 
by helmet usage, as helmeted riders were significantly more likely to be transported with minor or moderate injuries (23%, compared to 19% for unhlemeted riders), and significantly less likely to be transported in critical condition (1.9% vs. 3.7%).  The mortality rate among helmeted riders (2.5%, or 31 of 1249) was also significantly less than that among unhelmeted riders (4.6%, or 86 of 1879).  Helmet status was not recorded for 13% (450) of these patients, whose disposition was generally more favorable than the other two groups of riders. 
*Not shown are 15 patients who were transported with injuries of unknown severity .
 
 Due to software changes, in -
formation on the type of vehicle was available only for the 2007 through 2008 period and from July, 2011 on -
wards.  Over those two time periods, 55% (1029 of 1868) of the riders were injured on motorcycles, 40% (750) were on mopeds, and vehicle status was unknown for the remaining 5% (89) riders.  These proportions did not differ significantly across coun-ties, although 64% of the riders in Kauai crashes were on motorcycles, compared to 52% to 56% for other counties.  Only 36% of the riders were wearing helmets at the time of the crash, 50% were not helmeted, and the status was not available for the remaining 14% of riders (Figure 71).  The proportion not wearing hel -
mets was significantly higher, nearly doubled, among the moped riders (68%), compared to motorcycle riders (38%).  These proportions are 84% and 43%, respectively, if riders with unknown helmet status are excluded. 
 The positive associations between helmet use and patient disposition (Figure 70, above) was apparent for both 
types of riders.  Helmeted moped riders were significantly less likely to be transported in critical condition or suffer fatal injuries (none among 94 riders), compared to unhelmeted riders (5%, or 26 of 510).  Similarly, the rate of these types of injuries was significantly lower among helmeted motorcycle riders (5%, or 26 of 530), compared to unhelmeted riders (15%, or 59 of 392).  The mortality rate among unhelmeted motorcycle riders (8.4%, or 33 of 392) was nearly 5 times that of helmeted riders (1.9%, or 10 of 530).  Figure 70.  Distribution of injury severity/transport status of motorcycle 
and moped riders treated by EMS personnel, by helmet usage, 2007-2011.

82 Probable alcohol use was noted for about 12% of the patients, as EMS personnel documented physical evidence 
(e.g. containers) at the crash scene, alcohol odor on the patients’ breath, or the patient admitted to alcohol consumption 
(Table 13).  This proportion was much higher among riders who crashed on Neighbor Islands (16% to 19%) than those who crashed on Oahu (10%).  Alcohol users were significantly older than occupants who did not use alcohol, but by only 1 year on average.  They were also more likely to be males, less likely to use helmets, and more likely to have been in a night time crash or a crash on the weekend.  There were also significant differences in the disposition of patients, as those who had used alcohol were three times as likely to have been transported in critical condition, or to have died, compared to those who did not use alcohol.  For the periods for which vehicle type was recorded, alcohol users were more likely to have been injured riding a moped (45%), compared to those who did not use alcohol (37%).  Alcohol use was significantly more likely among moped riders than motorcycle riders (16% vs. 13%, respectively).

 no hel met no helmet This section summarizes results from the 2007 EMS data that was linked to multiple data systems: FARS, death 
certificates, DOT reports, and hospital records.  Only about two-thirds (65%, or 538) of the 822 EMS records for injured 
Hawaii residents were probabilistically linked to DOT records, a lower proportion compared to injured occupants (72%, see page 63).  That proportion only varied across counties by 60% (Kauai) to 66% (Honolulu).  Hospital records were de -
terministically linked to 92% (600) of the 653 patients who were transported to hospitals by EMS.  Hospital records were also linked to 51 additional EMS patients who refused EMS transport but apparently took private vehicles to hospitals.  
 Only 38% of the injured riders were wearing helmets at the time of the crash (Figure 72).  This proportion dif -
fered greatly by the type of rider, as 54% of motorcyclists were wearing helmets, compared to only 15% of moped riders.  (Helmet status was known for all but 3 (0.4%) of the riders.)  Helmet use was highest among riders who crashed on Oahu (44%), 37% on Kauai, 28% in Hawaii County and only 26% in Maui County.  The high proportion for riders on Oahu was mainly due to the 63% usage rate among motorcyclists injured there, compared to 35% to 48% of motorcyclists injured in other counties.  Riders who used helmets were significantly younger (32 years, on average) compared to unhelmeted riders (36 years), and significantly more likely to be males (87%, vs. 81% males among unhelmeted riders).

were transported and eventually discharged from the ED, nearly one-third (30%) were hospitalized, and 3% (26) ultimately 
died from their injuries (Figure 73).  The remaining 6% were transported by EMS, but could not be linked to hospital re -
cords.  Paramedic described “minor” injuries for 66% of these patients, and “serious” injuries for 34%.  This distribution is closer to that patients whose medical records showed a discharge from ED (49% with “minor” injuries, 51% with “seri -
ous”), than for patients who were eventually hospitalized or died from their injuries (13% minor, 87% “serious” or worse).    
 
 Helmeted riders had a significantly lower rate of the most severe injuries, those requiring hospitalization or result -
ing in death (28%, or 89 of 313), compared to unhelmeted riders (37%, or 186 of 506).  The incidence of traumatic brain injury was nearly twice as high among unhelmeted riders (31%), compared to helmeted riders (18%).  
 
 There were no significant differences in the average hospital charges for helmeted and unhelmeted riders treated 
in either the ED ($4,363, on average) or inpatient setting ($70,139).  The average length of each hospitalization was some-what longer among unhelmeted riders (9.5 days, vs. 7.0 for helmeted riders), but not to a statistically significant degree.

85 The odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death were 40% higher among un -
helmeted rides compared to helmeted riders, and the former also had more than twice the odds of a fatal injury (Table 
14).  The odds of sustaining a traumatic brain injury were also more than double among unhelmeted riders compared to helmeted riders.  All of these excess risk estimates were statistically significant and adjusted for the possible influence of rider age and gender and the county in which the crash occurred.  The protective effects of helmet use were magnified if only motorcycle riders were considered.  Unhelmeted motorcycle riders had twice the odds of an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death, more than 3 times the odds of a fatal injury, and 3 times the odds of a TBI.  In contrast, none of these odds varied significantly by helmet usage among moped riders, although it was not possible to asses the risk of fatal injuries, since there only 3 among all 320 moped riders and none among the 48 who wore helmets.

 About one-fourth (26%) of the injured resident motorcycle/moped riders in the HTR tested positive for alcohol, 
including 21% (178) with BAC levels of 0.08 or greater, and 14% (117) with BAC levels of 0.16% or greater (Figure 74).  
Moped riders were significantly more likely than motorcyclists to have been drinking (31% vs 24%, respectively).  More than half (54%, or 464) of the riders tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, including most (78%) of the 285 moped rid -
ers.  The most commonly occurring drugs were narcotics (21% of patients), THC (17%), and amphetamines (9%).  Moped riders were significantly more likely to test positive for THC (24%, vs 15% for motorcyclists).  
 There were no significant differences in the age or gender distribution of riders who were drinking and riders who 
tested negative for alcohol.  Helmet usage was significantly lower among the former, however, as only 17% wore helmets, compared to 37% of the non-drinkers.  Among motorcyclists, helmet usage was 52% among the non-drinkers compared to only 23% among those who were positive for alcohol.  Alcohol usage was comparable between riders who crashed on weekends and those who crashed on weekdays (26% for each group), but 4 times more common among those who crashed during night time (54%) compared to those who crashed between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (14%).  The mortality rate among drinkers (7.5%, or 17 of 226) was significantly higher than that among non-drinkers (3.8%, or 17 of 448).  This elevated risk of mortality was more apparent among the motorcyclists than the moped riders.

13  The ages of the victims 
ranged broadly from 1 to 97 years, 
although nearly half (47%, or 61) were 65 years or older (Figure 76).  Most (80%, or 49) of the senior-aged victims were struck on Oahu, although the 5-year pedestrian fatal-ity rate for senior residents on Oahu (35.9/100,000) was statistically com-parable to the rate for Neighbor Is-land senior residents (22.4/100,000).  Nine of the victims were either 1 (7 victims) or 2 (2 victims) years of age.  Seven of these victims were run over in private driveways, mostly (6 vic-tims) by a sports utility vehicle.  The majority (86%, or 75) of the 130 total victims were males, although female comprised the majority (6 of 9) of toddler-aged victims and senior-aged victims (56%, or 34 of 61).  The 13 deaths among residents aged 85 years and older translated into the highest fatality rate (39.2 deaths/100,000), followed by 75-84 year-olds (39.2) and 65-74 year-olds (24.2).  Rates for all other age groups ranged from 0 to 10.5 deaths/100,000 residents.

25 Fatal injuries
 Pedestrian crashes were 7th 
leading cause of fatal unintentional injuries, as 130 pedestrians were killed in Hawaii over the 5-year pe -
riod.  The annual number of deaths varied inconsistently between 16 and 37 (Figure 75).  The deaths were caused by 129 separate crashes, as 1 crashs involved 2 victims.  More than two-thirds of the victims (69%, or 90) were struck on Oahu.  An -
other 21 were struck on the island of Hawaii, 15 in Maui County (all on the island of Maui), and only 4 on Kauai.  The unadjusted 5-year mor -
tality rate for Honolulu County (10.3 deaths/100,000 residents) was significantly lower than the rates for Hawaii (13.8) and Maui (13.3) counties.  There were no significant differences in standardized fatalitiy rates between any county, although these comparisons are limited by the small sample sizes for other than Honolulu County.   
 There was no apparent pattern to the month of the year or day of the week in which these fatal crashes occurred.  
Unlike many other categories of injuries (e.g. drownings, homicides, car crashes) there was not a high frequency of pe-destrian fatalities on weekends.  The lowest totals were seen for Wednesdays and Thursdays (14 crashes each), with totals varying between 19 and 21 crashes for the other days of the week.  The crashes occurred at all hours of the day, but there were two noticeable peak periods: 27 crashes (21% of the total) occurred between 5:31 a.m. and 9:29 a.m., and 40 (31%) took place between 5:31 p.m. and 11:29 p.m..  (These statistics exclude 2 deaths (2% of the total) for which the time of Figure 75.  Annual number of pedestrian fatalities among Hawaii resi-

victims during the morning peak were 65 years of age or older, while most (75%, or 30 of 40) of those struck during the 5:31 p.m. to 11:29 p.m. peak were under 65 years of age.  Most (81%) of the senior-aged victims (85%) and all 9 who were under age 15 were struck during daylight hours (5:31 a.m. to 7:29 p.m.).  In contrast, most (73%) of the victims aged 25 to 54 years were hit during nighttime hours, between 7:31 p.m. and 5:29 a.m.  There were no associations between time of the crash and day of the week or county. 
 Only about one-third of the victims (34%, or 45) were known to have been in a crosswalk at the time of the 
crash, usually at an intersection (29% of victims) (Figure 77).  There were nearly equal numbers of victims who were hit at intersections (50, or 38%) and who were hit on open stretches of roadway (46, or 35%).  Another 8% were hit while on the shoulder of the road, 8% in driveways, 5% in parking lots, and 6% in other off-road environments (e.g. sidewalks, bus stops, etc.).  The environment differed between senior-aged victims and those under 65 years of age, as the former were more likely to be hit in a crosswalk (56% vs. 16%), while younger victims were likely to be hit in driveways (10% vs. 5% for senior-aged victims), on road shoulders (14% vs. none), and on open stretches with no crosswalk (43% vs. 15%).  Victims hit on Oahu were more likely to have been in a crosswalk than those hit on Neighbor Islands (44% vs. 13%).
Figure 77.  Number of pedestrian fatalities among Hawaii residents, by location on roadway, 2007-2011.
 Only 80% (84) of the 105 fatalities from 2007 to 
2010 could be matched to FARS records, since this only includes pedestrians hit on public roadways, and also ex -
cludes those who died more than one month after the crash.  FARS data contains information on alcohol involvement in the crash, and contributing factors for both pedestrians and drivers involved in the crashes.  The rest of this section (excluding the maps) will utilize only the data from the 84 pedestrian deaths (from 84 separate crashes) that were linked to FARS records.  
 The most common speed zone for the 125 crashes 
was 25 miles per hour (45%, or 38 crashes).  Another 35% (29 crashes) were in 30 to 35 mph zones; only 18% (15) were in 40 mph or faster zones.  Crashes on Oahu were more likely to be in 25 mph or slower zones, compared to those on Neighbor Islands (58% vs. 24%).  Almost two-thirds than half (63%) of the senior-aged victims were hit in 25 mph or slower zones, compared to 33% of pedes -
trians under the age of 65 years.  All but 5 of the crashes occurred on roads with two-way traffic, usually (66%) with undivided lanes.  Most (80%, or 67) of the crashes involved a vehicle going straight.  Most of the remain -
ing crashes (15%, or 13) involved a vehicle making a left turn, and 1 crash happened while a car was changing lanes.  (This information was not available for the remaining 3 crashes.)  Crashes on Neighbor Islands (88%) were more likely to involve cars going straight, compared to crashes on Oahu (76%).    Pedestrians

Alcohol Drugs Alcohol and/or drugs 
positi ve negative  not tested  unknown  positive More than one-quarter (26%) of the 84 fatally injured pedestrians tested positive for alcohol, and 25% had BAC 
levels of 0.08% or higher (Figure 78).  Alcohol use was significantly higher among male victims (42%) compared to fe -
males (6%).  Drinkers were also significantly younger on average than those who tested negative for alcohol (44 vs. 66 
years).  The highest prevalence of alcohol use was seen among victims in the 21 to 34 year age group (70%, or 7 of 10), and the 35 to 54 year age group (52%, or 11 of 21).  Only 5% (2 of 41) of the senior-aged victims tested positive for alco -
hol.  Alcohol use was four times as prevalent among pedestrians hit on the Neighbor Islands (56%) compared to those hit on Oahu (14%).  There was little association between alcohol use and the day of the week the crash occurred.  However, alcohol use was much more likely among victims hit between 7:31 p.m. and 5:29 a.m. (51%, or 18 of 35), compared to those struck during the daylight hours (8%, or 4 of 49).  
 Alcohol was actually involved in 33% (28) of these 84 fatalities, as 6 pedestrians who tested negative for alcohol 
were hit by drivers who had been drinking.  Overall, 15% (13) of the 88 drivers involved in the crash tested positive for alcohol, including 6% (5 drivers) who had BAC of 0.08% or higher .  
 
 Opiates (5 victims), methamphetamine (5), and thc (3) were the most commonly detected drugs among the 84 
decedents.  The profile of drug users was similar to that for pedestrians who tested positive for alcohol: drug users were younger, and more likely to be males.  Drug use was also more common among pedestrians who were hit during nighttime hours (31% of victims, vs. 12% for victims hit at other times), and among pedestrians hit on Neighbor Islands (48% vs. 8% for pedestrians hit on Oahu).  
 Overall, 37% (or 31) of the 84 victims were possibly impaired by alcohol and/or drugs.  This proportion was 
particularly high among younger victims (83% of the 24 victims between 21 and 49 years of age), those hit on Neighbor Islands (76%), and those hit during nighttime hours (66%).

substance use According to FARS data, 39% (33) of the pedestrian victims were in the roadway erroneously, most commonly 
by “improper crossing of roadway or intersection”, including jaywalking (21%, or 18 victims) (Figure 79).  Including the 
victims who tested positive for alcohol or drugs, 54% (or 45) of the pedestrians made an error that contributed to the crash.  Pedestrians who tested positive for alcohol or drugs were significantly more likely to have been in the roadway illegally, usually while crossing, than were the other victims (66% vs. 22%).  
 More than half (59%, or 52) of the 88 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash.  Most commonly, they 
were described as “inattentive” (38%), failed to yield the right of way (25%), or were speeding (18%).  One-quarter (25%) tested positive for alcohol or drugs.  Errors were documented for about two-thirds (67%, or 40) of the 60 drivers involved in crashes in Honolulu County, a significantly higher proportion than for drivers involved in crashes in other counties (43%, or 12 of 28 drivers).

91 The approximate location of the pedestrian crashes for Oahu and the Neighbor Islands are shown in the following 
maps.  The areas of Kalihi-Palama (13 deaths), Waianae (10), Waipahu (6), and Makakilo/Kapolei, McCully/Moiliili, and 
Waikiki (5 each) had the highest totals on Oahu (Figure 80).  The highest numbers of crashes on the Neighbor Islands were generally in the urbanized parts of Maui and Hawaii, with 10 in Wailuku, 6 in North Kona, and 5 each in the Lahaina, South Hilo and Puna districts (Figure 81).

93Nonfatal injuries
 There was a slight decrease in the annual number of nonfatal injuries among pedestrians that were treated in EDs, 
although the total changed little after 2008 (Table 15).  There was no apparent trend in injuries requiring hospitalization.  
Gender was nearly equally distributed, with slightly more males for both ED visits (55%) and hospitalizations (56%).  These proportions were reversed among senior-aged patients, of whom 59% were female and 41% were male.  Patient age was widely distributed, but one-third (32%) were in the 5 to 24 year age group.  Patients who were hospitalized were generally older; 27% were 65 years or older, compared to 13% of patients who were treated in EDs.  About three-fourths (72%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County, including 78% of those who were admitted to hospitals.

the highest rates for injuries treated in 
EDs, with a peak in the 15 to 19 year age group (Figure 82).  Rates for ED visits were relatively low for ages 30 and older, especially among residents aged 85 years and older.  A different pattern was seen for hospitalizations, with low rates for residents under 60 years of age, but progressively higher rates among older residents.  For all injuries (combining ED visits and hospitalizations), there were two peak age ranges: from 5 to 24 years of age (60 injuries/100,000 residents), and 65 years and older (50/100,000).

 Residents of Maui County 
had the lowest rates of all nonfatal pe -
destrian injuries (ED visits combined with hospitalizations), although none of the rate differences between coun-ties were statistically significant (Fig -

were in “non-traffic” environments, including private roads, driveways and parking lots (Figure 84).  That proportion 
varied by the county of residence of the patients, however, and was significantly higher for patients from Oahu (90%) and Maui counties (93%), compared to those from Hawaii or Kauai counties.  Proportionally more of the injuries treated in EDs were from non-traffic crashes compared to those requiring hospitalization (14% vs. 7%), perhaps reflecting higher speeds among the latter types of crashes.  Patients who were injured from non-traffic crashes were significantly younger on average than those involved in traffic crashes (34 vs. 38 years, respectively), as there were more young patients (ages 1 to 14 years) among those who were injured in non-traffic crashes (30% vs. 18%, respectively).

96 Patients were hospitalized for 9 days on average, and hospitalizations comprised most (73%) of the total days of 
care from nonfatal injuries to pedestrians and 87% of the associated medical charges (Table 16).   More than half (61%) of 
the hospitalized patients had fractures, most commonly leg fractures (27%), and one-quarter (26%) had internal injuries.  Thirty-nine percent of these patients had a traumatic brain injury.  Fractures (13%) and internal injuries (5%) were much less common among the pedestrians treated in EDs, about half (48%) of whom were treated for contusions or superficial injuries.

all crashes patients under 65 year of age senior-aged patients There were 2,335 EMS records for Hawaii residents who were treated by EMS personnel for occupant injuries 
over the 2007 to 2011 period.  (Records for 182 patients whose residence could not be determined were excluded.)  To 
avoid double-counting of injuries, the records of  22 patients who were transferred to another ambulance were excluded, resulting in the final sample of 2313 records.  Included in this total were 114 patients who ultimately died from the crashes, since this is an important outcome to examine in terms of patient age.  (All of these deaths were confirmed by linkage to death certificates.)   
 The patients were injured in 2,225 separate crashes, as most (96%) crashes involved only a single patient.  There 
were 2 peak periods for the time of the crashes, from 6:31 a.m. to 8:29 a.m. (13%, or 287 crashes), and from 2:29 p.m. to 7:29 p.m. (35%, or 788 crashes) (Figure 85).  Most (76%, or 1682) of the crashes occurred during daytime hours (5:29 a.m to 7:30 p.m.).  The time distribution differed by patient age, as crashes with senior-aged pedestrians were more likely to occur during daytime hours (86%), compared to crashes involving pedestrians under 65 years of age (73%).  Only a minor -
ity (12%) of the night time crashes involved senior-aged pedestrians.  
 There was no clear pattern as to the day of the week for crashes, although the lowest totals occurred on Sundays 
(10%, or 218 crashes, compared to 318 to 358 crashes for other days of the week).  Nearly one-third (31%) of the crashes on weekends occurred during nighttime hours (31%), compared to 22% of crashes during the week.

98 The locations with the 3 highest pedestrian crash totals on Oahu were all in the metropolitan Honolulu area: Ala 
Moana/Kakaako, Kalihi-Palama, and Downtown (Figure 86).  Other high frequency areas were Waianae, Waipahu, and 
Waikiki.  South Hilo had the highest total among Hawaii County districts, while most (63%) of the crashes on the island of Maui were in the Wailuku district (Figure 87).  There were only 8 crashes on the island of Molokai and 2 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

no transport  
 minor/mo derate serious  died  minor/moderate About half (51%, or 1187) of the pedestrians either refused EMS transport to hospitals (19%), or were trans -
ported with only “minor” or “moderate” injuries (32%) (Figure 88).  Another 41% (1670) were transported with “seri -
ous” injuries, 61 in “critical” condition, and another 114 who ultimately died.  (The latter status included those described 
as deceased on the scene as well as those linked to death certificates after they were transported to hospitals.)  
 Patient condition differed by age, as senior-aged pedestrians were significantly less likely to not be transported, 
compared to pedestrians less than 65 years of age (15% vs. 20%, respectively), and had a significantly higher mortality rate (10.3%, or 47 of 456, vs. 3.6%, or 67 of 1855).  The mortality rate was also significantly elevated among pedestrians who were hit during night time hours (7.4%, or 42 of 566), compared to those hit between 5:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (4.1%, or 72 of 1747), despite the younger age distribution among the former.  Pedestrians hit on Neighbor Islands had generally worse dispositions compared to those hit on Oahu, with proportionally fewer released at the scene (14%, vs. 20% for Oahu patients), and more who ultimately died (7.6% vs. 4.2%).

101 Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients, as EMS personnel documented physical evidence 
(e.g. containers) at the crash scene, alcohol odor on the patients’ breath, or the patient admitted to alcohol consumption 
(Table 17).  This proportion was much higher among pedestrians who were hit on Neighbor Islands (16%) than among those hit on Oahu (7%).  There were no differences in average patient age across the groups, but the alcohol users were significantly less likely to be seniors (2%) compared to the others (20% to 22%).  They were also more likely to be males, and more likely to have been injured in a night time crash or a crash on the weekend.  Patients who had used alcohol had generally worse dispositions, and were more than three times as likely to require transport in critical condition, and nearly twice as likely to have died, compared to those who did not use alcohol.

 Only 16% of the injured pedestrians in the HTR had been drinking at the time they were hit (Figure 89).  This 
percentage was significantly higher among those under 65 years of age (22%), as only 2% (3) of the 138 senior-aged pedes -
trians tested positive for alcohol.  Illicit drug usage was documented for 25% of the patients, including 30% of those who 
were under 65 years of age.   Considered together, about one-third (34%, or 164) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, although that proportion was much lower among the senior-aged patients (12%), compared to younger patients (43%).  Narcotics were the most commonly found illicit drug (16% of patients), followed by THC (8%), and am-phetamines (6%).  Most (87%, or 13) of the 15 senior-aged pedestrians who were positive for drugs had used narcotics; less than 2% were positive for THC or amphetamines.  
 Alcohol use was significantly more likely among the male pedestrians (23%) compared to females (7%), and 
among those hit on weekends (21% vs. 14% for those hit on weekdays).  Alcohol use was nearly 8 times likely among pedestrians hit during night time hours (41%) than among those hit between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (5%).  Alcohol use was not significantly associated with final disposition of patients, including the mortality rate.

 Fatalities among bicyclists 
were the least common type of fatal -
ity from motor vehicle crashes.  There 
were 15 fatalities among resident bi-cyclists in Hawaii, with the annual total varying between 2 and 4 (Figure 90).  Most (80%, or 12) of the victims were injured on Oahu, and the re -
maining 3 on the island of Maui; there were no deaths on Hawaii or Kauai counties over the 5-year period.  
 The age of the victims was 
broadly distributed over the range of 18 to 86 years (Figure 91).  Almost all (87%, or 13) of the victims were males.  There were no patterns regard -
ing the month of the crash or the day of the week.  About two-thirds (64%, or 9 of 14) of the crashes occurred during daylight hours between 7:31 a.m. to 7:29 p.m., but there were no notable peak times.  (This information was missing for 1 crash.)     
 Only 2 (13%) of the victims 
were known to be wearing a helmet at the time of the crash.  Eleven (73%) were not wearing a helmet, and this information was missing for the re-maining 2 bicyclists.Figure 90.  Annual number of bicyclist fatalities among 
Hawaii residents, by county, 2007-2011.

falling off the bicycle.  All 11 fatal crashes that involved a motor vehicle from 2007 to 2010 were linked to FARS records.  
The rest of this section (excluding the maps) will utilize only the data from these 1 1 deaths.  
 Most (64%, or 7) of the crashes occurred in a 35 mile per hour zone.  One was in a high speed environment (45 
mph), and the remaining 3 were in 30 mph or slower zones.  Most (64%, or 7) of the crashes occurred on roads with undi -
vided two-way traffic; 3 other crashes were on divided roadways, including 2 on highways, and the remaining crash was on a highway off-ramp.  Most (64%, or 7) of the cyclists were hit while on the roadway, with only 2 of those occurring at intersections.  Almost all (91%, or 10) of the vehicles involved in the crashes were going straight on the road; 1 vehicle was making a right-hand turn.  
 Two (18%) of the 11 bicyclists tested positive for alcohol, and 4 (36%) tested positive for drugs, including 2 who 
had used amphetamines.  Overall, about half (54%, or 6) of the victims tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  Only 1 of the 11 drivers involved in the crashes tested positive for alcohol (5 were not tested), and 1 tested positive for drugs (methamphetamine).  
 Besides substance use among 54% (6) of the bicyclists, 2 were traveling against traffic at the time of the crash and 
another failed to yield the right-of-way (Figure 92).  Four (36%) of the 11 drivers made an error which contributed to the crash, most commonly substance use and speeding (2 instances each).

105 The 12 fatal crashes on distributed across 10 districts, with the highest totals (2 deaths each) in the North Shore 
and Kalihi-Palama districts (Figure 93).  There were 3 fatal crashes on the island of Maui, 2 in Wailuku and 1 in Lahaina 
(Figure 94).  There were no fatalities in either Hawaii or Kauai counties over this 5-year period.

107Nonfatal injuries
 There was a consistent increase in annual number of ED visits for nonfatal injuries among bicyclists over the 2008 
to 2011 period (Table 18).  There was no apparent trend for the annual number of injuries that required hospitalization.  The 
number of injuries treated in EDs outnumbered those requiring hospitalization by more than a 10-to-1 ratio.   Most (75%) of the patients were males, including 80% of those who were hospitalized.  Patients who were treated in EDs were sig -
nificantly younger than those who were hospitalized (average age 27 vs. 39 years, respectively).  Almost one-third (32%) of those who were treated in EDs were between 5 and 14 years of age, compared to 20% of those who were hospitalized.  Senior residents comprised only about 4% of the patients overall.  About two-thirds (63%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County.

had the highest rates both for injuries 
treated in EDs and those that required hospitalizations (Figure 95).  Combin -
ing both types of injuries, rates for 5 to 14 year-olds (244 injuries/100,000 residents) were more than 3 times higher than rates for residents of other ages (74/100,000).  Rates for injuries treated at the ED level generally de-clined among residents aged 50 years and older, while there was a peak in hospitalizations among 45 to 64 year residents. Figure 95. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for nonfatal injuries from bicycle 
crashes in Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 The rate for ED visits for 
Kauai County residents was signifi -
cantly higher than the rates for any other county, and approximately double the rate estimates for residents of Honolulu or Maui counties (Fig-ure 96).  The rate for Hawaii County residents was also significantly higher than the rates for Honolulu residents, although 35% lower than the rate for residents of Kauai County.  Simi-lar relationships were found when comparing rates of all types of inju-ries (those treated in EDs combined with those requiring hospitalization).  There were no significant differences in hospitalization rates between coun-ties.  Figure 96. Age adjusted annual rates (per 100,000 residents)

Honolulu and Maui County residents compared to residents of Hawaii or Kauai counties.  Proportionally more of the inju -
ries treated in EDs did not involve motor vehicles, compared to crashes requiring hospitalization (88% vs. 71%), perhaps reflecting greater injury severity the latter types of crashes.  Forty-percent of the patients who were injured from non-motor vehicle crashes were under 15 years of age, compared to 14% of those who were hit by motor vehicles.  Almost all (94%) of the crashes that involved a motor vehicle occurred in traffic environments (i.e. on public roadways).

110 Although almost all (92%) of the patients were treated in EDs, hospitalizations comprised 32% of the treatment 
days and 66% of the total medical charges (Table 19).   The average hospitalization lasted about 5 days and generated over 
$36,000 in medical charges.  Most (63%) of the hospitalized patients had fractures, including 15% with skull fractures and 20% with leg fractures.  Thirty-eight percent of these patients had a traumatic brain injury, compared to 16% of those treated in EDs.  Contusions and superficial injuries (26%) and open wounds (25%) were the most common types of injuries among patients treated in EDs, followed by fractures (23%), most commonly of the arms (1 1%).

over the 2007 to 2011 period.  Included in this total were 11 patients who ultimately died from the crashes, since this is an 
important outcome to examine in terms of helmet  usage.  (All of these deaths were confirmed by linkage to death certifi-cates.)   
 The patients were injured in 1,870 separate crashes, as nearly all (99%) crashes involved only a single patient.  
Most (73%, or 1,366) of the crashes were distributed over the 11-hour period of 7:31 a.m. to 6:29 p.m., with a peak from 4:31 p.m. to 6:29 p.m. (17%, or 318) (Figure 98).  This time distribution was similar for crashes that involved motor vehicles and those that only involved bicyclists.  Almost one-third (31%, or 583) of the crashes occurred on a weekend, including 17% (311) on Sundays.

112 The 4 highest crash locations on Oahu were in the metropolitan Honolulu area, including 134 in the Ala Moana/
Kakaako Neighborhood Board (Figure 99).  There were also high numbers in the North Shore and Kailua.  South Hilo 
district had the highest total in Hawaii County, and most of the crashes on the island of Maui were in either Wailuku or Lahaina (Figure 100).  There were only 8 crashes on the island of Molokai and 2 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

involving only bicycles, and 26% (487) in crashes in which this status was not known.  Because of software changes, 
crash type was known for all 1,177 patients injured during the 2009 to 2011 period: 53% of the injuries involved motor vehicles and 47% did not.  There was also a significant proportion (22%, or 408) of patients for whom helmet usage was not recorded, although this information was nearly complete for years 2009 and 2010: 27% (187) of the 700 bicyclists wore helmets, 71% (493) did not, and this status was unknown for the remaining 2% (12) of riders.  For this 2-year period, helmet usage was more common among bicyclists injured on weekends (33%, vs. 24% for those injured during the week), and in daytime crashes (29% vs. 17%, respectively).  Helmeted riders were significantly older (41 years on average, vs. 35 years), and more likely to be female (30%, vs. 23% females among unhelmeted bicyclists).  
 There were relatively few injuries graded as “critical” (1%, or 18), or which resulted in death (0.6%, or 11) among 
the injured bicyclists (Figure 101).  More than one-quarter (28%) of the patients did not require transport to hospitals, and roughly equal numbers were transported with minor or moderate injuries (36%) or serious injuries (34%).  Bicyclists in -
jured in crashes that did not involve motor vehicles were surprisingly less likely to be released at the scene (23%, vs. 32% for those hit by motor vehicles), and more likely to be transported in serious condition (39%, vs. 31%).  Crashes involving motor vehicles were significantly more likely to result in fatal injuries (1.2%, or 10 of 856), compared to crashes that only involved bicyclists (0.2%, or 1 of 554), however.  
 Patient condition was generally comparable between helmeted and unhelmeted bicyclists, except for the most se -
rious injuries.  Unhelmeted riders had a significantly higher proportion of “critical” or fatal injuries (2.1%, or 22 of 1031), compared to helmeted riders (0.7%, or 3 of 458).  These differences were accentuated among crashes that involved motor vehicles, as the proportion of unhelmeted bicyclists with critical or fatal injuries was 3.1% (17 of 540), compared to 0.9% (2 of 214) among helmeted riders.  This difference was only of “borderline” statistical significance, however (p=0.08).

EMS personnel, by age group, 2007-2011.

115 Probable alcohol use was noted for about 9% of the patients, as EMS personnel documented physical evidence 
(e.g. containers) at the crash scene, alcohol odor on the patients’ breath, or the patient admitted to alcohol consumption (Ta -
ble 20).  Patients who used alcohol were significantly older than other patients and were more likely to be male.  Weekend 
and night time crashes were also more likely among the drinkers.  Only 4% of these patients were wearing helmets at the time of the crash, although this status was not known for 32% of these patients.  If only the 906 bicyclists with known al -
cohol and helmet status were considered, helmet use was 5 times higher among those who did not consume alcohol (35%), compared to the drinkers (5%).  Patients who had used alcohol had generally worse dispositions, with a significantly lower proportion that were released at the scene and a higher proportion (49%) transported in “serious” condition.

certificates, DOT reports, and hospital records.  Only 37% (157) of the 426 EMS records for injured Hawaii residents were 
probabilistically linked to DOT records, a lower proportion compared to injured occupants (72%, see page 63).  This indi -
cates many of these injuries resulted from crashes that did not involve motor vehicles.  Hospital records were deterministi -
cally linked to 90% (287) of the 319 patients who were transported to hospitals by EMS.  Hospital records were also linked to 25 additional EMS patients who refused EMS transport but apparently took private vehicles to hospitals.  
 Only 21% (90) of the injured bicyclists were known to be wearing helmets at the time of the crash, 52% were not 
wearing a helmet, and this status was not known for the remaining 27% (1 14) patients.  
 About two-thirds (65%) of the bicyclists were eventually discharged from the ED, including 57% for whom ED 
records could be located (Figure 102).  Only 18% were released at the scene, 16% were eventually hospitalized, and 4 (none of whom were wearing helmets) ultimately died from their injuries.  Patient disposition was generally better among helmeted bicyclists, as they were more likely to have been released at the scene and less likely to have suffered injuries re -
quiring hospitalization than unhelmeted riders.  None of these differences were statistically significant, however.  The two groups were also comparable in the incidence of TBI (29% and 28%, respectively), average medical charges, and length of hospitalization.  These comparison are limited, however, by the large proportion (27%) of patients with unknown helmet status and the relatively small sample size, especially for serious injuries.

* Includes 114 riders for whom helmet status was not known. Bicyclists
117 The odds of sustaining an injury that required hospitalization or resulted in death were 80% higher among unhel -
meted rides compared to helmeted riders, although this estimate was only of “borderline” statistical significance (p=0.11) 
(Table 21).  (These statistical models did not included the 114 patients with unknown helmet status.)  If only crashes that included motor vehicles were included, unhelmeted riders had nearly 4 times (3.7) the odds of a hospitalization or a fatal injury.  This estimate was statistically significant, although it was based on only 3 hospitalizations among the helmeted rid -
ers and did not include 237 bicyclists (56% of the total) for whom helmet usage or crash type was not known.  There was little association between helmet use and the odds of a TBI.

 Only 1 1% of the injured bicyclists in the HTR had been drinking at the time they were injured (Figure 103).  This 
percentage was nearly three times higher among those hurt in crashes that did not involve a motor vehicle compared to 
those who were hit by motor vehicles (15% vs. 6%, respectively).  Most (87%, or 27) of the 31 riders who tested positive for alcohol had BAC levels of 0.08% or higher.  About one-quarter of the bicyclists tested positive for illicit drugs, and this proportion did not differ by the type of crash.  Narcotics were the most commonly found illicit drug (17% of patients), followed by THC (13%), and amphetamines (7%).  Overall, one-third (33%, or 89) of the 271 patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  
 Alcohol use was not significantly associated with patient age, gender, or the day of the week of the injury, but 
alcohol positive bicyclists were twice as likely to have been hurt during nighttime (55%) compared to non-drinkers (25%).  None of the 28 bicyclists who had been drinking were wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, compared to 27% usage among those who tested negative for alcohol, and 31% among those who were not tested.  Alcohol use was not significantly associated with final disposition of patients.

11 3 1 Fatal injuries
 Falls were the most common 
type of fatal unintentional injury in 
the state, with the 541 deaths account-ing for 25% of the total.  There was no clear trend in the annual number of deaths in the state, although the highest level was seen in 2011 (Figure 104).   More than three-fourths (78%, or 423) of the injuries occurred on Oahu.  About half (48%, or 57) of the 118 fatalities on the Neighbor Islands occurred on the island of Hawaii.Figure 104. Annual number of fatal falls among Hawaii 
residents, by county, 2007-2011.
 More than three-fourths 
(79%, or 430) of the falls victims were aged 65 years or older, and 70% (377) were 75 years or older (Figure 105).  Male victims outnumbered females overall (58% vs. 42%), but gender was equally distributed among senior-aged victims (226 males and 204 fe-males).  In contrast, 78% (87 of 111) of the victims under 65 years of age were males.Figure 105. Age and gender distribution of victims of

Oahu residents Neighbor Island residents  Most (81%, or 347) of the 
430 senior-aged victims of falls were 
residents of Honolulu County (Figure 106).  The fall fatality rate estimate for senior-aged residents of Hono -
lulu County was significantly higher than the rates for residents of Kauai or Maui counties, and 45% higher than for Neighbor Island residents con-sidered as a whole.  Hawaii County residents had the highest rates among the Neighbor Islands, although there were no significant differences among these counties.  However, these rate estimates are based on low numbers of deaths, which limits the reliabil-ity of statistical comparisons between Neighbor Islands.  Figure 106. Number and rate of fatal falls among senior-aged residents in 
Hawaii, by county of injury, 2007-2011.
(Rate is per 100,000 senior-aged residents, age adjusted to the 
2000 U.S. population distribution.)
 The rate of fatal falls among 
senior-aged residents increased dra -
matically with age.  For example, the 5-year mortality rate for those aged 85 years or older (758/100,000 residents) was 14 times higher than the rate among 65 to 69 year-olds (53/100,000).  The increasing risk across age groups was apparent for senior-aged residents of both Oahu and the Neighbor Islands (Figure 107).  However, rates were consis-tently higher among Oahu residents, including significant differences for residents aged 85 years and older.  Figure 107.

Although there are some specific types of falls listed, the most common causes were vague, including 48% from falls “on 
the same level” with no further description, and “unspecified” falls (32%).  All but 1 of the 12 victims who died from falls involving beds were 65 years or older, and 7 were more than 80 years old.  Similarly, seniors comprised most of the victims who fell on stairs or steps (91%), or who fell on the same level from a slip or trip (86%), or other falls on the same level (85%).  Most of the victims of falls from cliffs or natural elevations (100%), trees (100%), or other falls from one level to another (91%) were under 65 years of age.  Only 1 of the 11 victims who fell from buildings or structures was under 24 years of age.    
Figure 108. Fatal falls among Hawaii residents, by type of fall and age of victim, 2007-2011.
 Sixty-one percent (327) of the 541 falls occurred in the home of the victim (323 falls) or their residential institu -
tion (4 falls).  This proportion was higher among the senior-aged victims (68%), compared to those under the age of 65 (32%).  The falls occurred fairly evenly over the days of the week.  There were also no clear trends across the months of the year.  These temporal descriptions  were similar when based only on fatal falls among victims aged 65 years and older.Falls
122Nonfatal injuries
 There was an increasing trend in the number of nonfatal injuries from falls that were treated in EDs, but no clear 
trend in the annual number of hospitalizations (Table 22).  There was an average of nearly 21,000 of the former and over 
2,700 of the latter types of injuries each year among Hawaii residents.  Gender was equally distributed among patients treated in EDs, but females comprised 59% of the patients that were hospitalized.  About two-thirds (68%) of the patients who were hospitalized were 65 years or older, compared to only 26% for those who were discharged from EDs.  About two-thirds of the patients treated in EDs (64%) and admitted to hospitals (69%) were residents of Honolulu County .

younger) and oldest (65 and older) 
Hawaii residents had the highest rates of nonfatal injuries from falls that were treated in EDs (Figure 109).  Rates decreased progressively from residents aged 4 years and younger to 20 to 24 year-olds, then rose gradu -
ally over the 25 to 64 year age range before increasing dramatically at ages 65 and older.  Rates of ED visits for residents aged 85 and older were 4 times those for 65 to 74 year-olds, and 5 to 8 times higher than rates for other adult-aged residents.  There was no peak in hospitalization rates for young children, although children under 10 years of age had the highest rates over the infant to 44 year age range.  Rates again increased greatly among senior-aged residents, being at least 14 times higher among those aged 85 years or older compared to residents aged 64 years or younger.  Hospitalization rates also increased sharply across the senior age range, approximately tripling across the age groups listed in Figure 85.   Figure 109. Average annual rates (per 10,000 residents) of hospitalizations 
and ED visits for nonfatal injuries from falls in Hawaii, 
by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 Rates of ED visits among 
residents of Hawaii and Kauai coun -
ties were significantly higher than the rates computed for Honolulu and Maui county residents (Figure 110).  Residents of Honolulu County had the lowest rates of hospitalizations, significantly lower than the rate com -
puted for residents of Hawaii County.  Figure 110. Age adjusted annual rates (per 10,000 residents)

124 The causes of the nonfatal falls are shown in Table 23.  The distribution of the causes was generally similar for 
injuries treated in EDs and those that required hospitalization, with somewhat vague causes (e.g. falls “on same level”, and 
“other”) being the most common.  Among the more specifically coded injuries, the most common causes were falls from stairs, steps and escalators (5.3% of the total), beds (3.7%), skateboards (3.5%), and chairs, playground equipment, and ladders (about 2% for each).
 Nearly half of the records from ED visits (48%) and over one-third of the hospitalizations (35%) contained no 
information on where the injury occurred.  The most commonly documented places were in the home (26% of ED records, 46% of hospitalizations).  About 6% of the ED records were coded for injuries in public buildings, and 6% in recreational sites, while 4% of hospital admission records were coded for injuries in public buildings.  Injuries to senior-aged patients were more likely to occur in their home or residential institution (39%), compared to injuries among younger patients (24%).  At least half (53%) of the falls that caused hospitalizations in seniors occurred in home environments.  This propor -
tion increases to 84% if only records with specific information on location are considered.

0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30%  Beginning in 2010, some hospitals started provid -
ing external cause status codes and activity codes.  Only 
about 5% of the 14,365 records with specific information indicated the patient was injured in a fall from an “activity done for income or pay”.  
 Information on patient activity was available 
for about 18% (9,185) of the 48,790 records from 2010 to 2011.  Activity codes were more likely to be provided in ED records (19%) compared to inpatient records (9%).  This proportion also varied across hospitals, with those in Hawaii County being most likely to provide activity codes (24% of records), and hospitals in Maui County being least likely (15%).  (Activity codes were provided for 20% of the records from Kauai County hospitals and 17% of the hospitals on Oahu.)  One-third (4 of 12) of the hospitals on Oahu essentially did not provide activity codes in their records.  
*Includes only hospital records with specific Activity codes, approximately 18% (9,185) of 48,790 total records for 2010 through 2011.  Codes were more likely to be present in ED records (19%) compared to inpatient records (9%).  The most common activity related to the falls was 
“walking, marching and hiking”, accounting for 30% of the total (Figure 111).  (E-codes indicated that most (73%) of these falls occurred in residences (45%), public buildings (13%), roadways (12%), or industrial areas (3%).  Rela -
tively few can therefore be assumed to be related to hiking.)  Skateboarding, running, tackle football, and bathing and showering were also prominent activities.  Activities re -
lated to sports (excluding walking and running) accounted for 36% of the total number of falls.  That proportion was much lower among senior-aged patients (3%), compared to younger-aged patients (45%).  Nearly two-thirds (65%) of the senior-aged patients fell while “walking marching and hiking”.  Other common activities among senior-aged patients were gardening and landscaping (7%), bathing and showering (6%), and other activities related to personal hy -
giene (5%).

126 Although ED visits for nonfatal falls outnumbered hospitalizations by more than 7-to-1, ED visits only accounted 
for 55% of the total number of patient days (Table 24).  This was because many of the hospitalizations involved long stays; 
almost one-third (31%) of the patients were hospitalized for 1 week or longer, and 8% for 2 weeks or more.  Long stays also increased the average charge per hospitalization to over $31,000, and the total costs to approximately $84 million per year, over twice the cost of ED visits ($34.1 million).  
 Fractures were by far the most common type of injury among residents hospitalized from nonfatal falls, present in 
nearly three-fourths (74%) of the patients.  About one-third (32%) had fractures of the femur (including 29% with fractures of the neck of the femur), and 10% fractures of the lower leg or foot.  Most of the other patients were hospitalized for in -
ternal injuries (19%).  There was a different pattern for injuries treated in EDs, as about half were contusions or superficial injuries (24%), or open wounds (20%).  About a quarter (23%) of the patients had fractures, most commonly the lower arm or hand (9%).  About one-fourth (24%) of the hospitalized patients had TBI, compared to 18% among those treated in EDs.  (TBI counts included diagnoses of any priority.)

nonfatal injuries from assaults among 
Hawaii residents over the 2007 to 2011 period.  (Excluding records for patients with unknown resident sta -
tus, those who were transferred to other EMS units (to avoid double-counting of injuries), and 177 pa-tients who were described as dead on arrival.)  These injuries resulted from 50,391 separate incidents, as almost all (99%) involved a single victim.  
 The incidents were broadly 
distributed in terms of time of day, al -
though most (77%) occurred during the day time period of 6:31 a.m. to 7:29 p.m. (Figure 112).  That propor -
tion was greater for senior-aged pa-tients (78%), including a peak from 7:31 a.m. to 12:29 p.m. (38%).  There was less of a peak among  patients under 65 years of age.  There was little variation in the day of the week for falls, with as each day accounted for between 13% and 15% of the total.  
 More than half (57%) of the falls occurred in the home or residence of the patient, and this proportion was sig -
nificantly higher among the seniors (71%) compared to younger aged patients (41%).  Other indoor location or buildings accounted for 16% of the falls, followed by streets and roadways (5%), and health care facilities (4%).  Only about 4% occurred in outdoor or recreation areas.  (These statistics include 13% of patients who fell in “other” locations.)  Female patients (52%) slightly outnumbered males (48%), although they constituted a greater majority (60%) among the seniors.  More than half (54%) of the patients were 65 years or older, including 22% who were 85 years or older.  Figure 112.  Time distribution of EMS-attended nonfatal 
injuries from falls, by patient age, 2007-2011.
(Horizontal scale indicates time of EMS dispatch, rounded up to nearest hour 
(military time scale, starting at 6:00am).  Vertical scale indicates percent

 Injuries from falls were gen -
erally more severe than other types of injuries treated by EMS, as only 15% of the patients were not transported to hospitals (Figure 113).  Nearly half (46%) were transported in “serious” or “critical” condition.  Senior-aged patients had worse dispositions, as they were more likely to be trans -
ported in serious condition and less likely to be released at the scene.  The proportion of patients who were trans-ported in critical condition was com-parable between the two age groups, however.  Patient condition was not associated with the time of day of the fall or the day of week.  Figure 113.  Distribution of injury severity/transport status of 
residents treated by EMS personnel for nonfatal injuries 
from falls, by age group, 2007-2011.
*Includes 152 patients for whom age was not recorded.Falls
128 Probable alcohol use was noted 8% (29%, or 3901) of the patients (Table 25).  Patients who had used alcohol 
were significantly younger than other patients, and nearly 3 times less likely to be in the senior age range.  Male patients 
were more than twice as likely to have used alcohol compared to females (12% vs. 5%), and this difference was consistent across both age groups.  There were no differences in the proportion of patients who were released at the scene, but drink-ers were significantly more likely to be transported in “serious” condition.  Patients who used alcohol were more likely to have fallen on weekends and nearly 3 times more likely to have fallen during night time hours.

 Only 1 1% of the adult-aged (18 years and older) HTR resident patients who were injured by falls were positive 
for alcohol use at the time of their injury, although more than half (53%) were not tested (Figure 114).  Alcohol use was 
nearly 4 times higher among patients in the 18 to 64 year age group (19%), compared to senior-aged patients (5%).  Fifteen percent of the patients tested positive for illicit drugs, most commonly narcotics (11%).  Almost all (97%, or 120) of the 124 senior-aged patients who were positive for drugs were positive for narcotics.  Considered together, about one-quarter (24%, or 587) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs, although that proportion was much lower among the senior-aged patients (13%), compared to younger patients (36%).  
 Alcohol use was significantly more likely among the male patients (9%) compared to females (3%), among those 
injured on weekends (16% vs. 9% for those hit on weekdays), and more than 4 times as likely among patient injured hit during night time hours (28%) than among those injured between 6:30 a.m. and 7:29 p.m. (6%).  Alcohol use was not sig -
nificantly associated with the mortality rate or likelihood of a discharge to a rehabilitation facility among the senior-aged patients.  Among younger patients, however, the mortality rate among the drinkers was significantly higher (7.0%, or 15 of 215), compared to those who tested negative (3.4%, or 13 of 380).

130 The remainder of this chapter will describe nonfatal injuries from falls among senior-aged residents.  As per 
residents of all ages, there was a generally increasing trend in the annual number of falls among seniors, and this was most 
evident for falls treated in EDs as there was an increase of 13% over the 5-year period (Table 26).  Females comprised two-thirds of the patients treated in EDs and 69% of those who required hospitalization.  More than one-third (39%) of the patients were 85 years or older, and this proportion was higher among patients who were hospitalized (46%).  The annual number of falls increased consistently across the age groups listed in Table 17.  Most (72%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County, and residents of Hawaii County comprised about half of the remainder (14% overall).  The number of Maui County residents who were hospitalized was approximately double the number from Kauai County (193 vs. 91 patients).

34  The increasing number of in -
juries from falls across the senior age 
range translated into extremely high rates for the oldest residents, for both injuries treated at EDs and those that required hospitalization (Figure 115).  Rates of ED visits among residents aged 85 years and older were 4 times higher than rates among 65 to 69 year-olds, while hospitalization rates were 10 times higher for the oldest group compared to the youngest.  Female residents had significantly higher rates of both kinds of injuries at every age group listed, with the exception of hospitalizations among 65 to 69 year-olds.  Age-standardized rates for ED visits were 35% higher among females than males (303 patients/10,000 resi-dents vs. 224/10,000), while hospital-ization rates were 52% higher among females (102/10,000 vs. 67/10,000), and these differences were generally consistent over the age groups shown in Figure 88.  Similar relationships between age and gender and nonfatal injury rates were seen within each of the 4 counties.  Figure 115. Rates (per 10,000 residents) of nonfatal injuries from falls 
among senior residents of Hawaii, by gender and level of care, 2007-2011.
*Indicates statistically significant difference in rate between males and females of that age group.
 The comparison of county-
specific rate estimates for senior resi -
dents (Figure 89) was similar to that for residents of all ages (see Figure 116): the highest rates for ED visits were computed for residents of Ha-waii and Kauai counties, significantly higher than the other two counties.  While rates for ED visits for Maui County residents were significantly lower than for any other county, Maui residents had the highest rate for hos-pitalizations, significantly higher than the rate for senior-aged residents of Honolulu County.  These patterns were similar when county-specific rates were computed separately for each gender. Figure 116. Age adjusted* annual rates (per 10,000 residents) of

(1835 total) There was little information on the cause of falls among seniors, as most of the injuries treated in EDs (84%) and 
requiring hospitalization (84%) were coded as “falls on same level” or due to “other” and “unspecified” causes (Figure 
117).  This lack of specificity may reflect either poor documentation in the medical records, or simply less involvement of the external environment as a cause of falls among seniors.  The proportion of records with these vague causes increased progressively across the age range of patients, from 78% among 65 to 69 year-old patients to 86% among those 85 years and older.  The distribution of the other, more specific, causes was similar between ED visits and hospitalizations, with stairs and steps and beds being the most commonly mentioned causes (about 4%).  
 There was no information on the location of the injury for over half (53%) of the ED records and 37% of the 
hospitalization records.  The most specifically coded injury location was the home, for both ED (34%) and hospitalization records (53%).  The proportion of falls in the home increased across the age range from 32% for patients aged 65 to 69 years to 43% for those 85 years and older.  
Figure 117. Causes of nonfatal falls among senior-aged Hawaii residents, by level of care, 2007-2011.  Falls
133 Because hospitalizations among seniors injured by falls were long (one week on average), the total number of 
patient days for hospitalizations was more than twice the number patient days in EDs (Table 27).  Among the patients hos-
pitalized, 37% stayed for 1 week or longer, and 9% for 2 weeks or more.  These long stays also resulted in a high average charge per hospitalization (over $32,000), with total annual charges being nearly 6 times higher than the charges for ED visits ($70.1 vs. $12.2 million).  
 The distribution of injuries among hospitalized seniors was similar to that for patients of all ages (see Table 16): 
three-fourths (75%) had fractures, and 20% had internal injuries.  Proportionally more of the fractures among seniors were femur fractures, however (41% vs. 32% for patients of all ages).  Almost all (93%) of the femur fractures among hospital-ized seniors were fractures of the neck of the femur, or hip fractures.  About one-third (30%) of the injuries treated in EDs were contusions or superficial injuries, 22% were open wounds, and 23% were fractures, most commonly fractures of the lower arm or hand (6%).  About one-fourth (23%) of the patients had TBI, and this proportion was similar across patients treated in EDs (22%) and those who were hospitalized (23%).  (TBI counts included diagnoses of any priority .)

 Drownings were the 4th 
leading cause of unintentional injury 
fatalities, with 175 fatalities over the 5-year period.  There were anywhere from 28 to 43 drownings per year among state residents, with the high-est total occurring in 2007 (Figure 118).  More than half of the drown -
ings (58%, or 101) occurred on the is -
land of Oahu, 39 (22%) on Hawaii, 22 (13%) in Maui County (18 on the is -
land of Maui, 2 on Molokai, and 2 on Lanai), and 13 (7%) on Kauai.  There was an increasing trend in the annual number of drownings on Oahu from 2008 to 2011 (from 11 to 29), but no apparent trends for the other counties.Figure 118. Annual number of drownings among Hawaii 
residents, by county, 2007-2011.
 Drownings occurred at every 
age but were least common among children and residents aged 65 years or older (Figure 119).  Seventy-eight percent (136) of the victims were be-tween the ages of 15 and 64 years.  The figure also shows that most (86%, or 150) of the victims were males.  The proportion of female victims was greatest in the youngest and oldest age ranges. Figure 119.

*NI=N eighbo r Island residents  (combined  total  of Haw aii, Kaua i and Maui counties).  *NI=Neighbor Island residents (combined total of Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui counties.) Most (70%, or 123) of the 
victims drowned in the ocean or other 
saltwater environments such as canals or harbors (Figure 120).  Eleven oth -
ers drowned in bodies of freshwater (streams, ponds, waterfalls), 27 in swimming pools, 11 in bathtubs, and 3 in other types of environments (e.g. drainage canal).  Most (81%, or 22) of the drownings in pool occurred on Oahu.  Most of the 11 bathtub drown-ing victims were either under 4 years of age (4 victims), or 68 years or older (4).  In contrast, only 3 (2%) of the 123 victims who drowned in the ocean were under 5 years of age, and only 9 (7%) were under age 18.  Residents in the 50 to 64 year age range comprised 39% (48) of the victims, and had the highest rates of ocean drownings.  Most (92%) were males.  Figure 120. Drownings of Hawaii residents, by 
environment and county, 2007-2011.
 Although the majority of 
the drownings occurred in Honolulu County, Figure 121 shows that the rates of both all types of drownings and saltwater drownings were lowest among residents of that county.  For either outcome, the rates for Honolu-lu County residents were significant -
ly lower than for residents of Hawaii County or Neighbor Island residents as a whole.  Among the Neighbor Islands, residents of Maui County had the lowest rates of both types of drownings, although the rates for all Neighbor Islands were statistically comparable.  Note that the saltwater drowning rates for Hawaii and Kauai counties were basically the same, but only the former was statistically dif-ferent from the rate for residents of Honolulu County.  This was prob-ably due to the low number of such drownings on Kauai County, which resulted in a relatively imprecise rate estimate and less power to detect a “significant” difference between the 2 counties. Figure 121. Rate of all types of drownings (left side) and 
saltwater drownings (right side)among Hawaii residents, 
by county of injury, 2007-2011.
(Rate is per 100,000 residents, age-standardized to the 2000 U.S. population 
distribution.)Drownings and Near Drownings
136 Figures 122 and 123 also show the approximate location of the drownings on Oahu and the Neighbor Islands, 
respectively.  (Four incidents were excluded since their approximate locations could not be determined.)  One-third (33%, 
or 9) of the 27 drownings in swimming pools were at a single family residence, about half (48%, or 13) were in condo -
miniums or apartment buildings, 3 in community centers, and the remaining 2 in hotel pools.  The 22 drownings on Oahu were widely dispersed around the southern and central parts of the island.  Similarly, the freshwater drownings were widely dispersed geographically, with at least 1 on each of the 4 main islands.  All 4 drownings in Hawaii County were north of Hilo, including 2 in the Wailuku River in Hilo.  
 About half (52%, or 36) of the 69 ocean drownings on Oahu were on the eastern part of the island, including 3 
near Ala Moana Beach Park, 3 along Waikiki Beach, 5 on the stretch from  Kapiolani Park to Diamond Head, 4 off Port -
lock,  and 5 near in Makapuu Bay.  There were also 8 drownings along the Waianae coast, and 7 on the North Shore, from Mokuleia to Turtle Bay.  
 Five of the 29 ocean drownings on the island of Hawaii were on the Kona coast (from Kailua south to Kealakekua 
Bay), 8 in the Puna district, and 6 on the southern tip of the island from Punaluu to Manuka Bay.  Most (7) of the 9 ocean drownings on Kauai were on the north and northeast coasts.  Drownings were widely dispersed in and Maui County, al -
though there were none in the Hana district.

were responsible for about one-fifth 
of the 123 drownings in  the ocean or other saltwater environments (Fig-ure 124).  Twelve of these 25 victims fell in or were swept in from shore while not engaged in any specific activity, 8 were fishing from shore, 3 were picking opihi, and another 2 drowned after boat accidents.  All 3 opihi pickers drowned on the island of Hawaii.  Swimming was the single most common activity among the vic -
tims (25 drownings).  Twenty-eight of the drownings were diving-related, and most of those (82%, or 23) were among “free” divers (i.e. those not us-ing scuba equipment). Figure 124. Saltwater drownings among Hawaii residents, by 
activity of victim, 2007-2011.
 Autopsy records were re -
viewed for all but 1 of the 48 ocean drownings in Honolulu County over the 2007 to 2010 period.  A number of personal factors were identified from autopsy records which at least partially contributed to the 48 salt -
water drownings.  These are factors which had nothing to do with the environment in which the person drowned, and are therefore referred to as intrinsic factors: circulatory dis -
eases, alcohol and drug use, seizure disorders, and traumatic injuries.  
 Intrinsic factors were in -
volved in 60% (28) of the 47 saltwa-ter drownings over this period (Fig-ure 125).  The most common intrinsic factor was circulatory diseases, which contributed to 38% of the drownings.  Most of these victims were noted to have ischemic heart disease or atherosclerosis.  Circulatory diseases were noted as possible cause in over half (60%, or 18) of the 30 drownings among victims aged 35 years or older, and in all 6 drownings among senior-aged victims.  Toxicology results were available for 45 of the victims.  Eight (17%) of the victims tested positive for illicit drugs, including THC (3 victims), methamphetamine (3), cocaine (1), and MDMA (1).  In comparison, only 5 (11%) had BAC levels of 0.08% or higher.  Overall, about one-fifth of the victims (21%, or 10) had been drinking or tested positive for illicit drugs.  That proportion was highest (50%, or 8) among the 16 victims in the 25 to 54 year age group.  Three of the sustained traumatic injuries which led to their drownings.  Figure 125.

139Nonfatal injuries
 There was non clear trend in the annual number of near drownings, which averaged 129 per year, most of which 
(77%) were treated in EDs (Table 28).  Male patients (76% of the total) outnumbered females by about three-to-one for 
both ED visits and hospitalizations.  Almost all the patients (89%) were under 55 years of age, and more than one-quarter (26%) were 15 to 24 years of age.  Nearly one-third (31%) of the hospitalized patients were under 5 years of age, compared to 14% of those who were treated in EDs.  About two-thirds (68%) of the patients were residents on Honolulu County.

age and those aged 15 to 24 years had 
the highest rates of ED visits, espe -
cially 15 to 19 year-olds (Figure 126).  Rates of ED visits generally decreased among residents 20 years and older.  The highest rates of hospitalization were computed for residents under 5 years of age, followed by those 5 to 9 years of age.  Hospitalization rates varied little over the succeeding age groups.  Figure 126. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for near drownings in 
Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 Residents of Maui County 
had significantly lower rates of ED visits, compared to residents of any other county.  The rate for Maui County residents was at least 4 times lower than the rates for residents of any other county (Figure 127).  The rates for the other 3 counties were statistically comparable.  However, hospitalization rates were highest for residents of Maui and Honolulu coun -
ties. Figure 127. Age adjusted annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of near 
drownings, by level of care and county of residence of patient, 2007-2011.Drownings and Near Drownings
141 About two-thirds (68%) of the near-drownings were related to “recreational activity without diving equipment”.  
Two-percent involved use of diving equipment, and 3% were related to unintentional immersions from water transport ac -
cidents.  Circumstances were “other” (20%) or “unknown” (4%) for the remaining near drownings.  Nearly half (45%) of 
the near drownings occurred on a Saturday or Sunday.  There were no apparent seasonal trends.  
 Hospitalizations were of a relatively short number of days (4.3, on average) (Table 29).  Because each hospitaliza -
tion incurred nearly $32,000 in charges, however, they comprised most (91%) of the total medical charges in the state.  In -
formation on location of the near drowning was missing or unknown for about half (48%) of the patients.  This proportion was lower (19%) among hospitalized patients, most of whom (58%) were in “other” environments, which could include beaches.  “Other” areas comprised about one-quarter of the near drownings treated in EDs, followed by recreation areas (18%), which includes public pools.  Only 4% occurred in home environments, which includes pools in private houses.  Besides the ICD-9CM code for “drowning and nonfatal submersion”, patients were most commonly hospitalized for fractures (12%), and internal injuries (5%).  Principal diagnoses for ED visits included submersion (28%), open wounds (26%), sprains and strains (12%), and contusions and superficial injuries (1 1%).

hospitals started providing external 
cause status codes and activity codes.  Information on patient activity was available for about 46% (112) of the 246 records from 2010 to 2011.  Ac -
tivity codes were more likely to be provided in ED records (50%) com-pared to inpatient records (34%).  This proportion did not vary signifi -
cantly across the county of the hos-pitals, but was higher in 2011 (56%) compared to 2010 (34%).  Most (75%) of the near drownings were related to “surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding”, or swimming (Figure 128).   The former category was more common among patients treated in EDs (46%, vs. 31% who were swimming), while 55% of the hospitalized patients nearly drowned while swimming.  The distribution of patient activity also differed by coun-ty, as 46% of those treated in Oahu hospitals had been “surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding”, compared to 17% to 25% of patients treated in other counties.    Figure 128.  Activity of patients treated for near 
drownings in Hawaii, 2010-2011.
*Includes only hospital records with specific Activity codes, approximately 46% (112) of 246 total records for 2010 through 2011.  Codes were more likely to be present in ED records (50%) compared to inpatient records (34%).  Number in parentheses is annual average number of patients. 
 EMS responded to 544 near 
drownings among Hawaii resident over the 5-year period.  (Excluding 12 records for patients who were transferred to other EMS units (to avoid double-counting of injuries), and 59 patients who were described as dead on arrival.)  These were 530 separate incidents, as 97% involved a single near drowning.  
 Almost all (92%) of the inci -
dents occurred during day time hours, with a broad peak between 11:31 a.m. and 5:29 p.m. (64%) (Figure 129).  More than one-quarter (26%, or 136) of the incidents occurred on a Sunday, and 18% on a Saturday; the total varied between 9% and 14% for weekdays.  
 More than one-third (38%) of the near drownings occurred in bodies of water, which could include both freshwa -
ter and saltwater environments.  Another one-third (33%) were in patient residences (16%), public buildings (9%), hotels (4%), and health care facilities (3%).  Most (65%, or 28) of the 43 night time incidents occurred in these types of environ -
ments.  Another 17% were in “recreation areas”, which could presumably include both indoor and outdoor settings.  Figure 129.  Time distribution of EMS-attended

143 The incidents on Oahu were widely distributed, with the highest totals in Waikiki, North Shore, Hawaii Kai, and 
Waianae areas (Figure 130).  The North Kona district had the highest total in Hawaii County, while the incidents in Maui 
and Kauai were more broadly distributed (Figure 131).  There were also 8 incidents on the island of Molokai and 4 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

Patient condition did not differ significantly by incident location, or the time of day of the near drowning or the day of 
week.  However, figure 132 shows patients older than 54 years of age were significantly more likely to be transported in serious or critical condition and half as likely to have been released at the scene.  Disposition was also generally better among female patients, including a significantly lower proportion who were transported in critical condition, compared to male patients (23% vs. 36%, respectively).

 Probable alcohol use was noted for only 4% (22) of the patients.  This proportion did not vary significantly by 
patient gender, residence status, or by county or day of week of incident.  There were also no significant associations be -
tween patient age or disposition and their use of alcohol, although these comparisons are limited by small numbers.  Near drownings  that occurred during night time hours were significantly more likely to involve alcohol consumption than day time incidents, however (23% vs. 2%).  
 
Trauma Registry Data

 Poisonings were the 2nd 
leading causes of unintentional injury 
fatalities in the state, with 490 over the 5-year period, or an average of 98 deaths each year (Figure 133).  There was a generally increasing trend in the annual number of poisonings, with a particularly large increase in 2011.  However, trends are difficult to examine because poisonings make up a large proportion of injury deaths where the intent could not be estab -
lished (see Figure 170), or they can also be classified as suicides.  There was no consistent trend in the an-nual number of poisonings of unde -
termined intent over this period, so the observed trend in unintentional poisonings was probably not due to disparities in coding.  It is also difficult to know the accuracy with which the intent was determined over the years and across the 4 different counties.  Most (82%) of the poisonings that were coded as unintentional occurred on Oahu.  However, if poisonings of undetermined intent are also included, that proportion drops to 63% because proportionally more of the poisonings on Neighbor Islands were coded as undetermined intent.  Most of the poisonings on Hawaii (67%, or 75 of 112) and Maui counties (69%, or 83 of 120) were coded as undetermined intent, compared to only 12% (53 of 453) of those on Oahu.  Figure 133. Annual number of fatal poisonings among 
Hawaii residents, by county, 2007-2011.
 Compared to most injury 
categories, the age distribution of poisoning victim was narrowly dis-tributed, with a peak among 35 to 64 year-old victims (Figure 134).  Most (81%, or 396) of the victims were in this 30-year age group, including 39% (193) who were 45 to 54 years of age.  Only 4 of the victims were under 18 years of age.  Figure 102 also shows that most (78%, or 381) of the poison -
ing victims were male.Figure 134. Age and gender distribution of poisoning

Unintentional poisonings Possible* unintentional poisonings  Figure 135 shows the uncer -
tainty of comparing poison fatality 
rates across the counties of Hawaii, given the differences in the coding of intent.  If only those poisonings that were coded as unintentional are considered, the rate was significantly higher among residents of Honolulu County compared to any other coun-ty, while the rates across Neighbor Islands were all statistically compa-rable.  However, if poisonings of un-determined intent are also included (right side of Figure 135), the rate for Honolulu County residents was significantly lower than the rates for residents of Hawaii or Maui counties. Figure 135. Five-year rates (/100,000) of unintentional poisonings 
and possible* unintentional poisonings, by county, 2007-2011. 
(Includes residents aged 20 years and older.  Rates are age-standardized to the 2000 
U.S. population distribution)
*Sum of poisonings of unintentional and undetermined intent.
 Almost all (93%, or 454) 
of the 490 unintentional poisonings were drug-related (Figure 136).  One-fourth (129 deaths) were classified as “other” or “unspecified” drugs, but there were two other major catego-ries: 1) narcotics, and 2) sedative-hypnotic and psychotropic drugs.  The former category includes most of the illicit substances, like heroin, cocaine, and morphine.  The latter category includes amphetamine, an-tidepressants, barbiturates, and tran-quillizers.  Deaths among residents of Neighbor Islands were much more likely to be coded as due to “other” or “unspecified” drugs, compared to deaths among residents of Honolulu County (53% vs. 20%).  The increas -
ing trends shown in Figure 101 were apparent for all 3 categories of drugs.  The 22 alcohol poisonings were approximately double 12 resident fatalities re-corded over the preceding 16-year period from 1991 to 2006.  Most of these victims (59%, or 13) were males in the 45 to 64 years age range; only 1 of the 22 victims was under 21 years of age. Figure 136. Fatal poisonings among Hawaii residents, by type, 2007-2011.Poisonings
148Nonfatal injuries
 There was an increasing  trend in the annual number of nonfatal poisonings treated in EDs, but no trend for those 
requiring hospitalization (Table 30).  The increasing trend in ED visits was apparent for residents of all counties except 
Kauai.  Gender was nearly equally distributed for both settings, with males in a slight majority (52% overall).   Patients who were hospitalized were significantly older than those who were treated in EDs (mean age: 47 vs. 30 years, respec -
tively).  More than one-quarter (28%) of those who were treated in EDs were under 5 years of age (compared to 9% of hospitalized patients), and only 9% were in the senior age range.  Age was more broadly distributed among hospitalized patients, although there was also a peak in the toddler age range; 8% were 1 to 3 years of age.  Honolulu County residents comprised more than two-thirds (68%) of the hospitalized patients.

 Residents of Honolulu and 
Maui counties had comparable rates of both ED visits and total (ED visits combined with hospitalizations) non-fatal poisonings (Figure 138).  These rates were significantly higher among residents of Hawaii and Kauai coun -
ties.  The total rate for Oahu and Maui County residents was 37% lower than for residents of Kauai County, and 38% lower than the rate for Hawaii County residents.  Maui County resi -
dents had a significantly lower rate of hospital admissions for poisonings than Hawaii County residents.  Other -
wise, hospitalization rates were com-parable across all counties.  Figure 138. Age adjusted annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of nonfatal

150 Patients were hospitalized for slightly over 3 days on average, and hospitalizations comprised 45% of the total 
number of days of care (Table 31).  The average charge for a hospitalization was nearly $18,000, however, over 11 times 
the average charge for an ED visit.  Hospitalizations therefore comprised most (77%) of the total annual charges of $4.8 million.  Most (76%) of the poisonings were caused by drugs or medicinal substances, including 92% of those that required hospitalization.  Poisonings from drugs or medicinal substances were particularly common among senior-aged patients (86%).  Narcotics caused 21% of the hospitalizations, tranquilizers 13%, aromatic analgesics (which include acetamino-phen, or Tylenol) 8%, and cardiovascular agents 8%.  The type of drug was more widely distributed among the ED visits, although aromatic analgesics (7%), tranquilizers (7%), and narcotics (8%) were among the most commonly coded.

 There were 149 suffocations 
between 2007 and 2011, with the an -
nual total varying inconsistently be-
tween 29 and 37 deaths (Figure 139).  There were also no apparent trends within victim age groups.  Most (89%, or 132) of these injuries occurred on Oahu, 10 on Hawaii, 5 in Maui Coun -
ty, and 2 on Kauai.  Most (92%, or 93) of the 101 deaths among senior-aged victims also occurred on Oahu.  The adjusted all-ages fatality rate was sig -
nificantly greater for Oahu residents (12 deaths/100,000 residents) com-pared to residents of the Neighbor Islands (4 deaths/100,000), as were senior-aged fatality rates (69 vs. 15 deaths/100,000 residents, respective-ly).   Figure 139. Annual number of fatal suffocations among 
Hawaii residents, by county, 2007-2011.
 Figure 140 shows there were 
two predominant age groups among the suffocation victims: infants and those over age 65.  Twenty-four (16%) of the victims were either in -
fants (22 victims) or 1 to 3 year-olds (2 victims), and 101 (68%) were 65 years of age or older, including 52 (35%) who were 85 years or older.  Males comprised two-thirds (67%) of the victims. Figure 140. Age and gender distribution of victims of suffocation

lation of “other” objects, again, with little additional information.  Almost all (91%, or 79) of these 87 victims were seniors, including half (51%, or 44) who were 85 years or older.  All 19 of the victims who suffocated in a bed or cradle were infants.  All but 1 of these victims were 4 months of age or younger, including 8 (42%) who were 1 month or less old.  Most (84%, or 16) of these 18 infants were residents of Honolulu County .Figure 141. Suffocations among Hawaii residents, by type, 2007-2011.
 Because infant suffoca -
tions can be coded as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or “other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (code R99), annual trends for all 3 types of infant deaths were examined (Figure 142).  Deaths coded as and “unspecified causes” (38) out-numbered those coded as suffocations in bed or cradle (19), or SIDS (17).  There were no consistent trends in the annual number of these potentially sleep-related deaths among infants, which varied inconsistently from 7 to 20.  Deaths among infant residents of Hawaii County were much more likely to be coded as SIDS (7 of 9, or 78%), compared to residents of other counties (18% to 24%).  Most (82%, or 61) of the 74 total decedents were under 5 months of age, although this proportion was higher for those deaths coded as suffocations (95%). Figure 142.

deaths among infant residents of Hawaii, by type, 2007-2011.Suffocations
153Nonfatal injuries
 There was a decreasing trend in the overall number of nonfatal suffocations in the state, due mostly to decreases 
in ED visits over the 2008-2010 period (Table 32).  This decrease was evident only among residents of Honolulu and Maui 
counties, however.  Gender was nearly equally distributed, with a slight majority (53%) of male patients overall.  A large proportion (7%) of patients were infants, including 13% of those who were hospitalized.  Residents 1 to 4 years of age comprised half (50%) of the patients treated in EDs and 7% of those who were hospitalized.  Seniors also made up a large portion (58%) of hospitalized patients, including 35% who were 85 years or older.  Oahu residents comprised 59%  of the patients.  There were nearly twice as many patients from Maui County compared to Hawaii County, despite a lower popu -
lation in the former.  Rates of ED visits for nonfatal suffocations were significantly higher among residents of Neighbor Islands (14 visits per year/100,000 residents) compared to Oahu residents (9 visits/100,000).  Hospitalization rates were statistically comparable, although this comparison is limited by the small numbers.

y  Nonfatal suf focation rates were highest for residents under 5 years of age, with a peak among 2 and 3 year-olds 
(Figure 143).  (These rate estimates combine injuries treated in ED and inpatient settings, since there were too few of the 
latter for separate calculations.)  Rates increased across successive age groups among residents 20 years and older, al -
though on a much lower scale than for children under 5 years of age.

155 Most (78%) of the total days of care were comprised of ED visits, as hospitalizations were only for 2.7 days on 
averages (Table 33).  However, the average medical charge for each hospitalization was nearly $13,000, so hospitalizations 
contributed 67% of the annual total of $0.3 million in charges.   According to E-codes, 61% of the hospitalizations were caused by inhalation of food and less commonly (33%) by inhalation of other (non-food) objects.  Non-food objects caused 61% of the ED visits for nonfatal suffocations, while inhalation of foods caused 38%.  Almost all (97%) the suffocations were diagnosed as “foreign body entering through orifice”.  The nose (50%) was the most common entry point for suffoca-tions treated in EDs, while the larynx (38%), esophagus (24%) and other parts of the respiratory tree (24%) were the most common locations for suffocations requiring hospitalizations.  Suffocations from foods were usually located in the pharynx (31%) and larynx (29%), while most (78%) non-food suffocations were located in the nose.

 Suicide was the single lead -
ing cause of fatal injuries among state 
residents, accounting for 24% of the total number of victims.  There were 795 suicides among state residents over the 5-year period, with an in -
creasing trend in the annual number (Figure 144).  The 195 deaths in 2010 was by far the highest total in the 19-year period (1991-2009) for which data was available.   Most (58%, or 465) of the suicides occurred among residents of Oahu.  Increasing trends were evident for residents of all counties, although the total decreased from 2010 to 2011 for all but Hawaii County.  The interpretation of annual trends for both the state and individ -
ual counties requires consideration of trends in the number of fatal injuries of undetermined intent (i.e. possible suicides, or less commonly, possible homicides), although those did not change much over the 5-year period (Figure 168).  Figure 144. Annual number of suicides among Hawaii residents, 
by county of residence, 2007-2011.
 The youngest aged victims 
were 10 years old, but almost all (95%, or 758) were 19 years or older (Figure 145).  Victim age was widely distributed, with 74% (592) in the wide range of 20 to 60 years of age.  The increasing trend (Figure 144, above) was evident in all age groups in the 15 to 74 year age range.  
 The figure also shows that 
male victims (606) outnumbered fe-males (189) by a 3-to-1 ratio.  That ratio was fairly constant across the age ranges, although smaller among the 37 victims who were 18 years or younger (25 males and 12 females).  There was an increasing trend in an-nual number of both male and female victims, with the 2010 totals being the highest since at least 1991 for either gender (46 females, 159 males.  Fatal-ity rates were highest for 45 to 54 year olds and residents aged 85 years and older (see Figure 20). Figure 145. Age and gender distribution of victims of

were residents of Oahu, the overall age 
adjusted rate (57.5 suicides/100,000) was 39% lower compared to that for residents of the Neighbor Islands (94.5).  The rates for each of the other 3 counties were statistically compara-ble, ranging only from 85.5/100,000 (Kauai County) to 98.6 (Hawaii County).  (The rate for Maui County was 94.9/100,000 residents.)  Fig -
ure 146 shows that suicide rates for Neighbor Island residents were higher than those for Oahu residents for most age groups, particularly for those 50 to 64 years of age. Figure 146. Five-year rates (/100,000) of suicide among residents of Oahu,

 Chinese residents had sig -
nificantly lower suicide fatality rates than any of the other ethnic groups, although the rate was based on only 16 deaths (Figure 147).  The rate was also low for Filipino residents, signifi -

dents, significantly higher than any group, other than Hawaiians.  Figure 147: Unadjusted rates (per 100,000) of suicides,

proximately 2 to 5 times higher than the rates for the other 3 ethnicities.  Hawaiians and Filipinos had gener -

The rates for 45 to 64 year-old residents and those aged 65 and older were significantly higher for Caucasians than any other ethnic group.  The rates for Caucasians in these latter two age groups were approximately 2 to 5 times higher than the rates for the other 3 ethnicities.  Hawaiians and Filipinos had generally similar patterns with peak rates in the 25 to 44 year age group, and lower rates for older age groups, although rates were higher among Hawaiian residents at every age group.   Figure 148: Suicide rates (per 100,000) among residents of Hawaii, 
by age group and ethnicity, 2007-2011.
 
 The most common mecha -
nism of suicide was by hanging or suffocation, which accounted for about half (49%) of the deaths (Fig -
ure 149).  Use of firearms was the sec-ond most common method, although it accounted for a much higher pro-portion of the suicides among males (24%), than among females (7%).  Other major mechanisms included jumps from high places (10%), and poisoning from medicinal substances (10%).  Besides firearms, male vic-tims were more likely to die by hang-ings/suffocations (51%), compared to female victims (43%), while females were more likely than males to use medicinal substances (21% vs. 6%, respectively).  Firearms were more commonly used among Neighbor Island victims (26%) than those on Oahu (16%), while the latter were more likely to have jumped from a high place (15% vs. 3% for Neighbor Island vic-tims).  Victims of hangings or suffocations (mean age 40 years) were significantly younger than other victims (50 years of age).Figure 149.  Suicides among male and female residents

autopsy records for suicide victims for years 2008 through 
2010, and a random selection of 2007.  Almost all (97%, or 306) of the 314 eligible records were reviewed.  Mani -
festations of mental illness were commonly documented in these records.  Figure 150 shows that almost two-thirds (65%, or 198) of the victims had a documented history of mental illness, most commonly mood disorders (178 victims, 58%), psychoses (31, 10%), or anxiety disorders (27, 9%).  (These percentages add to more than 65% be -
cause 39 victims had more than 1 type of mental illness.)  A mental illness diagnosis was provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist or mental health case worker for 25% (77) of the victims.  Mental illness was described by a surviving spouse or intimate partner for 10% (32), by another fam-ily member for 23% (70%), by other lay person for 4% (13), and by an unknown source for the remaining 2% (6 victims).  Only about one-third (32%, or 63) of the victims described as mentally ill were in treatment near the time of the suicide.  Another 11 victims (6%) had been in treatment at earlier points in their lives.  Barriers to mental health treatment were described for 24 of the victims, most com-monly their non-compliance with medications (10) and/or refusal of treatment or therapy (15).  Concerns over insur -
ance were noted for only 2 of the mentally ill victims.  
 About one-fifth (19%, or 57) of the victim tested 
positive for psychiatric drugs, including benzodiazepines (42 victims), anti-depressants (17), anti-psychotics (6), and anxiolytics (5).  (Note: it is possible that the drugs la -
beled for “psychiatric” uses in this report, were actually prescribed for other purposes, e.g. as anti-convulsants, or muscle relaxants.)  The proportion who tested positive for these substances was higher among those described as mentally ill (25%), particularly those diagnosed by a men-tal health professional (31%).  Thirty-percent (93) of the victims were described by survivors as “depressed” before the suicide, 56% had verbally threatened suicide, and near -
ly one-third (32%) had made a previous attempt.Suicides

ship problems (34%, or 103 victims).  About one-third (36) of these victims specifically had issues with the endings of relationships.  Relationship issues were most common among victims under 50 years of age (44%, or 87 of 197 victims).  Serious illness was documented for about one-quarter (26%) of the victims overall, and one-half (60%, or 29 of 48 victims) of senior-aged victims.   Problems at work (including loss of job), financial problems, bereave-ment, homelessness or residence issues, and family crises or discord were documented for 11% to 8% of the victims.  Among the 24 victims under the age of 21, the most preva -

2010 are summarized in Figure 152.  (These percentages 
exclude 4 (1% of 306) victims who were not tested or for whom test results were not available.)  One-quarter (25%, or 75) of the victims had BAC of 0.04% or greater, includ -
ing 57 (19%) with BAC of 0.08% or greater, the level used to indicate inebriation among drivers in Hawaii.  (These proportions were similar if only victims aged 21 years and older are considered: 26% and 20%, respectively.)  About 11% (32) of the victims had BAC levels of 0.16% or greater (i.e. twice the legal limit).  Males and females were statistically comparable in the proportion of victims with BAC levels of 0.04% or greater, and the proportion who were legally intoxicated.  Victims who were legally intoxicated were significantly younger, on average, than victims who tested negative for alcohol (39 vs. 47 years of age, respectively).  
 Toxicologic exams identified illicit drugs in the 
blood of about one-third (34%, or 103) of the victims.  (The term “illicit” here includes thc, cocaine, methamphet -
amine, as well as morphine and opiates, which also have medicinal uses.)  This proportion was significantly higher among male victims (39%) compared to female victims (22%).  The most commonly identified drugs were opi-ates, present in 14% (43) of the victims, followed by meth -
amphetamine (12%), cocaine (5%), and marijuana (6%).  Male victims were significantly more likely to test positive for methamphetamine (15%), compared to female victims (4%).  Eleven (4%) of the victims tested positive for more than one of the drug groups at the time of autopsy.  The av-erage age of victims who had used drugs was significantly younger than that of those who had not (42 vs. 47 years, respectively), although there was a wide age distribution (standard deviation 15 years) among the drug users.  There were no significant associations between alcohol use and the prevalence of illicit drugs, which was 33% for victims who were negative for alcohol, and 37% for those with a BAC of 0.04% or higher.  (This proportion was 28% for the 18 victims with a BAC between 0.01% and 0.03%.)

 Apart from the toxicology results, over one-third (37%, or 112) of the 306 victims had a documented history of 
substance abuse.  The most commonly abused substances were alcohol (24%, or 73 victims), methamphetamine (13%, or 40 victims), cocaine (4%, or 12 victims), and prescription drugs (4%, or 13 victims).  Substance abusers were significantly younger than the other victims (mean age: 41 vs. 47 years). Suicides
162Nonfatal injuries
 There was an increasing trend in the annual number of nonfatal suicide attempts overall, although this was evident 
only for ED visits (Table 34).  (There were 5 patients under 10 years of age with E-codes indicating self-inflicted injuries.  
These 5 records were assumed to be erroneously coded and excluded from these analyses.)  The number of injuries that required hospitalization were not much lower than the number treated in EDs, unlike most any other category of injury.  The gender distribution of patients was similar for both settings, with females comprising a slight majority of patients.  Slightly more than half (56%) of the patients were under 15 to 34 years of age, compared to only 31% of those who died from suicide over the 2007 to 2011 period.  Proportionally more of the patients treated in EDs were in the 15 to 24 year age group (40%, compared to 27% of hospitalized patients), while there were more patients aged 45 years and older among those who were hospitalized (35%, vs. 18% of ED patients).  About two-thirds (64%) of the patients were residents of Honolulu County.  Among Maui County residents, patients who were hospitalized outnumbered those who were treated in EDs.

years had the highest rates of hospi-
talizations and especially ED visits (Figure 153).  Injury rates generally declined gradually from age 20, al -
though the rate of hospitalizations changed little between 30 and 54 years of age.  Residents aged 50 years and older were more likely to be hos -
pitalized for nonfatal attempts than to be treated in ED settings.  
 Female residents had signifi -
cantly higher rates of both ED visits (53/100,000 residents) and hospi -
talizations (37/100,000) than male residents (34 and 28/100,000, respec -
tively).  However, these gender dif-ferences were only significant for the 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 year age groups for ED visits, and the 15 to 19 year age group for hospitalizations; male and female resident rate estimates were statistically comparable for all other age groups.  If all nonfatal injuries (ED visits and hospitalizations combined) were considered, rates for females were also significantly higher in the in the 25 to 29 year age group.   Figure 153. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for nonfatal injuries from suicide

 Residents of Kauai and Ha -
waii counties had significantly higher rates of ED visits for nonfatal suicide attempts, compared to residents of Honolulu and Maui counties (Figure 154).  The hospitalization rates were statistically comparable across coun-ties, except for a significantly higher rate among Hawaii County resi-dents compared to Honolulu County residents.  The total rate (ED visits and hospitalizations combined) for residents of Kauai County was 75% higher than that for Oahu residents, and nearly double that for residents of Maui County.  The total rate for Ha-waii County residents was also signif -
icantly higher than the rates for resi -
dents of Honolulu and Maui counties, but comparable to the rate for Kauai County.  These rate comparisons were complicated by injuries coded as un -
determined intent, or possibly self-inflicted (see figure 172). Figure 154. Age adjusted annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of nonfatal

Annual number of injuries shown in parentheses. Fifty-eight percent of the 
ED visits and most (85%) of the 
hospitalizations were caused by poi-sonings from drugs or medicinal substances (Figure 155).  The most common poisonings were from the “analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-rheumatics” class (22% of ED vis -
its, 33% of hospitalizations), which includes both narcotics (heroin, and other opiates), as well as aspirin and acetaminophen.  Poisonings from “tranquilizers and other psychotropic agents” were also common, account-ing for 16% of the ED visits and 29% of the hospital admissions.  Injuries from cutting or piercing instruments comprised 15% of the attempts over -
all, including 23% of those treated in EDs.  Very few of these nonfatal attempts were from hangings or use of firearms, reflecting the lethality of these mechanisms.  Female patients were more likely to attempt by drug or medicinal poisonings (76%, vs. 62% for male patients.  There were few differences in mechanism across the county of residence of the patients.

Hawaii residents, by level of care, 2007-2011.  
 
 Patients were hospitalized for an average of nearly 5 days, so admissions constituted the bulk of days of patient 
care and total medical charges (Table 35).  As described by mechanism, the majority (73%) of injuries were from poison -
ings, particularly for hospital admissions (89%).  (These proportions do not exactly match those shown in Figure 124 be -
cause the former are based on E-codes, while these values are derived from diagnosis codes.)  Open wounds and contusions or superficial injuries constituted most of the remaining ED visits.

There were 112 victims of homicide over the 5-year period, with a de -
creasing trend from 29 in 2008 to 17 in 2011 (Figure 156).  The 112 vic -
tims died in 111 separate incidents, as only 1 incident claimed more than one life.  The figure shows that the majority of victims (72%, or 81) were killed on the island  of Oahu.  More than half (55%, or 17) of the remain-ing 31 victims were killed on Hawaii, 7 in Maui County (1 on Lanai, the other 6 on the island of Maui), and 7 on Kauai.  There were too few fatali-ties to compute county-specific rate estimates.   5-year age standardized fatality rates were statistically com -
parable across all counties, although these comparisons were based on small numbers for all but Honolulu County.  The rate for Honolulu County residents (8.8/100,000 residents) was similar to that for residents of all Neighbor Islands (8.4/100,000).  Figure 156. Annual number of homicides among Hawaii 
residents, by county, 2007-2011.
 Most (80%, or 90) of the vic -
tims were between 18 and 60 years of age, with a peak in the 35 to 44 year age group (Figure 157).  There were also 2 infant victims and anoth-er 4 who were under 5 years of age.   Males comprised a slight majority of the victims (66, or 59%), although gender was equally distributed among the youngest and oldest victims. Figure 157. Age and gender distribution of homicide

yrs.   Figure 158 shows the highest 5-year homicide fatality rate was computed for 35 to 44 year-old residents (15 
deaths/100,000 residents), significantly higher than the rates for the youngest (under 25 years of age) and oldest (65 years 
and older) residents.  The rates for 25 to 34 year-olds and 45 to 54 year-olds were also significantly higher than the rate for residents under 15 years of age. 
Figure 158. Rates (/100,000 residents) of homicide in Hawaii, by age of victim, 2007-2011.
 Firearms were the most common means of homicide (35% of victims, followed by stabbings (28%), and physical 
force or unarmed beatings (25%) (Figure 159).  The proportion of murders from firearms was significantly higher among Neighbor Island victims (55%) than residents of Honolulu County (27%).  There were no significant differences in mecha-nism between male and female victims.

to 2009 were linked to Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) to 
provide additional data on the incident.  The following statistics therefore refer only to those 67 deaths that were linked to the UCR data .  The proportion of linked records was similar for homicides in Honolulu County (90%), and Neighbor Islands (91%).    
 According to UCR data, most (73%, or 49) of the 
67 victims knew their assailants; only 19% (13) were killed by strangers.  (The victim-perpetrator relationship was not known for 5 (7%) of the homicides linked to UCR.)  Vic -
tims were most commonly killed by someone in their fam -
ily (37%, or 25) (Figure 160).  Family member consisted of roughly equal numbers of intimate partners (12 victims) and “other” family members (13).  The 12 intimate partners were mostly (83%, or 10) wives of the perpetrators; there were 2 other victims described as “boyfriends”.  “Other” family members included 6 children of the perpetrators, 3 victims killed by in-laws, and 3 others killed by aunts or cousins.  All but 1 of the 5 victims who were under 8 years of age were killed by family members.  Most (79%, or 19) of the 24 victims were killed by someone they knew outside of their family were killed by an “acquaintance”.  Three others were killed by neighbors, 1 by a co-worker, and 1 by a “friend”.  
 Figure 160 also shows that female victims were 
more likely to be killed by their intimate partners (37%), than were male victims (5%).  Male victims were more likely to be killed by extra-familial acquaintances (40%) or strangers (25%), compared to female victims (26% and 11%, respectively).  Victims killed on Neighbor Islands were more likely to have been killed by other family mem -
bers (40%, vs. 11% for Oahu victims), while Oahu victims were more likely to have been killed by a stranger (26%, vs. 5% for Neighbor Island victims).  
Figure 160. Victim-to-assailant relationship for homicides among Hawaii residents, 
by gender, 2007-2009.
 Limited information was available on the circumstances of the murders, as most resulted from “arguments” (40%) 
or “other” reasons (39%).  Five deaths resulted from robberies (including 2 victims who knew their assailants), and 2 from burglaries.  Only 1 murder was attributed to the narcotics trade.Homicides
168Nonfatal injuries
 There were no trends in the number of nonfatal injuries from assaults in the state, or within any county (Table 36).  
Males comprised two-thirds (67%) of the patients treated in EDs and an even greater proportion (89%) of those who were 
hospitalized.  Very few (less than 1%) of the patients under 5 years of age and most (94%) were 15 years or older.  More than half (58%) were 15 to 34 years of age.  Only 2% were in the senior age range.  Honolulu County residents comprised nearly two-thirds (64%) of the patients treated in EDs, and almost three-fourths (72%) of those who were hospitalized.

ED visits and hospitalizations was the 
15 to 29 year age group, particularly 20 to 24 year-olds (Figure 161).  The rates for both types of injuries gradu-ally decreased from this peak over the succeeding age groups.  Rates of nonfatal injuries treated in EDs were lowest for the youngest (under 5 years of age) and oldest (75 years and older) residents.  Hospitalization rates were slightly elevated among residents un -
der 5 years of age compared to rates for 5 to 14 year-olds (6 vs. 3 hospi -

 The rate for ED visits for

nificantly higher than for any other county, while the rate for residents of Honolulu County was significantly lower than any other county (Figure 162).  These county differences were also true for all types of injuries (com -
bining both ED visits and hospitaliza -
tions).  In contrast, the hospitalization rates for residents of Kauai and Ha-waii counties were significantly lower than the rates for residents of Hono -

170 Patients were hospitalized for nearly 5 days on average, with over $31,000 in charges for each admission (Table 
37).  Unarmed beatings caused nearly three-quarters (70%) of all injuries, and 61% of those that required hospitalization.  
Injuries from stabbings (14%) and beatings from blunt objects (11%) were more common among patients who were hospi-talized compared to those who were treated in EDs (3% and 8%, respectively).  Firearms comprised only a small propor -
tion (2% or less) of either type of injury.  
 Fractures were the most common type of injury that required hospitalization (53%).  Forty-four percent of patients 
admitted to hospitals had a skull fracture.  Internal injuries were also common (28%) among hospitalized patients.  Injuries treated in EDs were most commonly contusions or superficial injuries (33%) or open wounds (22%).

all injuries no transport/minor/moderate injuries serious/critical EMS responded to 13,297 nonfatal injuries from assaults among Hawaii residents over the 2007 to 2011 period.  
(Excluding records for patients with unknown resident status, those who were transferred to other EMS units (to avoid 
double-counting of injuries), and 52 patients who were described as dead on arrival.)  These injuries resulted from 12,651 separate incidents, as most (96%) involved a single victim.  
 The number of incidents generally increased over the course of the day (starting at 6 a.m.), reaching a broad peak 
during the 7:31 p.m. to 2:29 a.m. period (48% of the total) (Figure 163).  The time distribution was generally later for patients who were transported in “serious” or “critical” condition, compared to those who were released at the scene or transported with minor or moderate injuries.  Almost one-third (32%) of the former types of injuries occurred during the midnight to 4:29 a.m. period, compared to 24% of the less serious injuries.  Saturdays (19% of injuries) and Sundays (18%) were the most common days of the week; the rest of the days of the week accounted for 12% to 14% of the injuries.  The home or residence of the patient was the most common location for the assault (40%), followed by other indoor loca -
tion or buildings (17%), most commonly “public buildings” (7%), and bars and restaurants (6%).  Another 9% were on streets and roadways.  (These statistics include 28% of patients who were assaulted in “other” locations.)   About 60% of the victims were males, but males accounted for 74% of patients transported in serious or critical condition.  Less than1% (83) of the patients were under 5 years of age; most (88%) were 18 years or older.  The peak age group was from 18 to 30 years (38%, or 5030 patients).  This age group accounted for nearly half (46%, or 3176) of the 6980 residents who were assaulted during night time hours.

172 Four of the 5 highest locations for assaults on Oahu were in the metropolitan Honolulu area, from Waikiki to 
Downtown (Figure 164).  There were also high totals in the Waianae, Waipahu, and Wahiawa areas.  South Hilo had the 
highest total among Hawaii County districts, followed by Puna and North Kona (Figure 165).  Most (87%) of the assaults on the island of Maui were in the Wailuku (58%) or Lahaina (29%) districts.  The Wailuku and Lahaina districts accounted for most (78%) of the crashes on the island of Maui.  There were also 68 assaults on the island of Molokai and 25 on Lanai (not shown on the Figure).

Overall, one-fifth (20%) of the injured were transported in serious or critical condition.  That proportion was highest among the senior-aged victims (29%), and those who were injured in Kauai (24%) or Hawaii counties (25%).  
*Includes 123 patients for whom gender was not recorded.
 Probable alcohol use was noted for nearly one-third (29%, or 3901) of the patients (Table 38).  This proportion 
was lowest among patients assaulted on Kauai (15%, vs. 30% for other counties), although the status was unknown for 51% of the Kauai patients (vs. 28% to 33% for the other counties).  Average age was comparable between the drinkers and non-drinkers, although the former were more likely to be in the 18 to 30 year age range.  The proportion of males among the drinkers was significantly higher than for the other groups.  Patients who had consumed alcohol were significantly less likely to be released at the scene, and twice as likely to be transported in serious condition, compared to other patients.  The proportion of drinkers who were transported in “critical” condition was significantly higher than that for non-drinkers, but lower than that among whom alcohol status was unknown.  Assaults on weekends and during night time hours were also significantly more common among patients who had been drinking than among other patients.

 Nearly half (46%) of the adult-aged (18 years and older) HTR resident patients who were injured by assaults 
were positive for alcohol, and more than one-third (38%) tested positive for illicit drugs (Figure 167).  Alcohol use was 
significantly greater among patients in the 18 to 30 year age range (51%), compared to older patients (41%), but there was no difference in drug use between the two groups.  About three-fourths (76%, or 286) of the 375 drinkers had BAC levels of 0.08% or greater.  THC was the most commonly documented drug (19% of the patients), followed by amphetamines (15%) and narcotics (15%).  Amphetamine use was more common among patients 31 years and older (18%), compared to those in the 18 to 30 year age group (11%), while THC was more commonly found among the latter (24%, vs 15% among older patients).  Considered together, about two-thirds (67%) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.
 Alcohol use was significantly more likely among the male patients (49%) compared to females (27%), among 
those injured on weekends (54% vs. 41% for those assaulted on weekdays), and among those assaulted during night time hours (54%, vs. 30% for those injured between 6:31 a.m. and 7:29 p.m.).  Alcohol use was not significantly associated with the mortality rate or the likelihood of a discharge to a rehabilitation facility, either among all patients or within the 2 age groups.

 This is a vague but important 
category to explore, since there were 
283 fatal injuries over the 5-year pe -
riod for which the intent could not be defined.  Figure 168 shows that there was no trend in the annual number of such deaths.  The total number was roughly equally divided between deaths that occurred on Hawaii, Ho -
nolulu and Maui counties; only about 9% occurred on Kauai.  The undeter -
mined intent designation was there -
fore more likely to be assigned to injury-related deaths that occurred on Neighbor Islands (from 13% for deaths on Kauai County to 20% for Maui County), than for those that occurred on Oahu (4% of all injury-related deaths).Figure 168. Annual number of fatal injuries of undetermined intent
 among Hawaii residents, by county, 2007-2011.
  The age distribution 
of these victims (Figure 169) was very similar to that for victims of uninten -
tional poisonings (see Figure 134).  There was a peak age of 45 to 54 years (37%, or 107 victims), and nearly three-fourths (73%, or 206) were 35 to 64 years of age.  Only 6 (2%) of the victims were under 20 years of age, including 3 who were infants.  As for most categories of injuries, male victims (185) far outnumbered female victims (111).  Figure 169. Age and gender distribution of victims of fatal injuries
 of undetermined intent in Hawaii, 2007-2011.Injuries of Undetermined Intent
177 Figure 170 shows that most (81%, or 229) of these fatal injuries were due to poisonings, specifically poisonings 
due to medicinal substances (57%, or 161).  Most (77%, or 177) of the 229 poisonings were among 35 to 64 year-olds, 
similar to the age distribution of unintentional poisonings (see Figure 134).  Less than one-fourth (23%, or 53) of these poi -
sonings occurred on Oahu; there were comparable numbers of deaths on Hawaii (75) and Maui counties (83).  In contrast, most (72%, or 13) of the fatal falls occurred on Oahu.  The 3 infant fatalities resulted from suffocations.

 There was an increasing trend annual number of nonfatal injuries of undetermined intent over the 2007 to 2010 
period, but a decrease in 2011 (Table 39).  Male patients (61% of the total) outnumbered females (39%).  Patients in the 15 
to 54 year age range comprised the majority of those treated in the ED (72%) and inpatient settings (77%).  Oahu residents comprised 69% of the patients treated in EDs, but only about half (55%) of those who were hospitalized.

during childhood until a sharp in -
crease among 15 to 24 year-old resi -
dents (Figure 171).  Rates remained 
high over the 15 to 49 year age range before decreasing steadily until in -
creasing among residents 85 years and older.  A peak in rates was also seen for hospitalizations among 15 to 24 year-old residents, although there were slightly higher rates among 45 to 54 years-olds. Figure 171. Average annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
hospitalizations and ED visits for nonfatal injuries of undetermined 
intent in Hawaii, by age of patient, 2007-2011.
 Residents of Kauai County 
had significantly higher rates of both ED visits and total (ED visits com -
bined with hospitalizations) injuries of undetermined intent, compared to residents of any other county (Figure 172).  The ED visit rate for Kauai County residents was 2 to 4 times higher than the rates for residents of other counties.  Residents of Hawaii County had the lowest total rates, and the lowest rates of ED visits.   Figure 172. Age adjusted annual rates (per 100,000 residents) of 
nonfatal injuries of undetermined intent, by level of care and

180 Patients were hospitalized for 5 days on average, and hospitalizations comprised 36% of the total number of days 
of care (Table 40).  The average charge for a hospitalization was over $28,000, however, and hospitalizations comprised 
74% of the total annual charges of $3.8 million.  The E-codes for most (82%) of the injuries treated in EDs indicated “other” or “unspecified” mechanisms of injury.  The most commonly specified type of injury was poisoning (14% of ED visits), specifically from drugs or medicinal substances (12%).  More specific E-codes were provided for hospitalizations, over three-fourths (77%) of which were caused by poisonings, usually (74%) from drugs or medicinal substances.  The most common types of injuries treated in EDs were sprains and strains (27%), contusions and superficial injuries (20%), and open wounds (16%).  Apart from the poisonings, there was a wide distribution of injury types among hospitalized patients, with fractures (10%) being the most common.

Hawaii (50, 15%) Kauai (56, 17%)Fatal injuries
 Up to this point, this report 
has included only information on fa-
tal injuries among Hawaii residents.  However, a total of 339 non-residents also died of injuries in Hawaii over the 2007 to 2011 period.  There was no clear trend in either the number of non-resident deaths and the number of incidents that caused the fatalities (Figure 173).  The 339 deaths were caused by 330 incidents.  Four non-residents died in a helicopter crash on Molokai in 2011, 3 in a helicop -
ter crash on Kauai in 2007, and 3 in a car crash on Maui in 2007.  There were 138 deaths on Oahu, 95 in Maui County, and nearly equal numbers in Kauai (56 deaths) and Hawaii (50) counties.  There were no apparent trends within counties.  More than three-fourths (78%, or 263) of the victims were residents of other U.S. states, and the remaining 23% (76) were residents of foreign countries.  Among the foreign residents, Japanese was the most common ethnicity listed on the death certificates (32 vic -
tims, or 42% of the total).  (Note that only information on victim ethnicity was available, not country of residence.)  Figure 173. Annual number of fatal injuries among non-residents
 in Hawaii, by county, 2007-2011.
 Almost half (43%, or 146) of 
the victims were between the ages of 45 and 64 years old, and most (85%, or 287) were 25 to 74 years of age.  In general, the age distribution of the non-resident victims was similar to that among resident victims, except there were proportionally fewer older victims (ages 75 and older) among the former (7% vs. 21%, respectively), and more victims in the 55 to 74 year age range (36% vs. 20%, respective -
ly).  Three-fourths (75%, or 253) of the non-resident victims were males, similar to the proportion for resident victims of fatal injuries (71%).  Figure 174. Age and gender distribution of non-resident victims

*mvc = motor vehicle crash  Most (82%, or 277) of the 
deaths were due to unintentional in -
juries.  Drowning was by far the lead-
ing cause, accounting for nearly half (46%, or 157) of all deaths, and more than all other unintentional causes combined (Figure 175).  This pro-portion was highest for non-resident deaths in Kauai (61%), and Maui (53%) counties.  Most (87%, or 136) of the drownings occurred in the ocean, 10 in streams or freshwater environments, and 9 in hotel swim-ming pools.  Non-resident drownings are discussed in more detail in the following chapter.  The 2nd leading cause was suicide, with most (69%, or 20) of the 29 deaths occurring on Oahu.  Motor vehicle crashes ac -
counted for 14% (47) of the deaths, including 25 deaths among car oc -
cupants.  According to FARS records from 2007 to 2010, 40% (8 of 20) of the fatally injured occupants were not wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.  Only half (12) of the 24 victims of fatal falls were 65 years of age and older; this proportion was much higher (79%) among Hawaii residents who were killed by falls.  All but 1 of the 18 poisonings were due to drugs, including 12 from narcotics and psychodysleptics.  Twelve victims died from 6 separate aircraft crashes, including 8 who died in 3 helicopter crashes.  Six of the 11 motorcyclists were killed in 2011.  Among the 5 motorcyclists killed from 2007 to 2010, only 1 was wearing a helmet, according to FARS records.  About half (46%, or 11) of the 24 deaths of undetermined intent were due to drug poisonings, 7 (29%) from drownings, and 4 (17%) from falls. Figure 175.  Fatal injuries among non-residents of Hawaii, 
by injury category, 2007-2011.  
 
 There was no clear trend in 
the number or rate of non-residents killed by injuries (Figure 176).  How -
ever, there was a consistent decrease in the deaths of non-residents from foreign countries, from 2007 (18 deaths) to 2010 (11 deaths), before an increase in 2011 (17 deaths).  Annual fatality rates followed the same pat-tern as the number of deaths, suggest -
ing there was no change in the risk of fatal injuries among non-residents over this 5-year period.  The estimat-ed fatality rates among non-residents from foreign countries were statisti -
cally comparable to those for resi-dents of other States for all years and for the 5-year period as a whole. Figure 176. Annual number and rate of fatal injuries among non-residents

countries (Figure 177).  The fatality rate for foreigners on Kauai was significantly higher than the rates for Honolulu and 
Hawaii counties.  Fatality rates among residents of other United States were statistically comparable across counties, with the exception of a higher rate for Kauai compared to Honolulu.  A similar pattern was seen when the total fatality rates (residents of foreign countries combined with residents of other States) were compared.  (Note that the rate estimates were based on fewer than 20 deaths for each of the Neighbor Islands and are therefore unreliable estimates.)

184Nonfatal injuries
 Most (85%) of the patients were residents of other U.S. states, and 15% were residents of foreign countries.  The 
number of non-residents who were treated in EDs for nonfatal injuries generally increased over the 2008 through 2011 
period, while the trend was less clear regarding the annual number of hospitalizations (Table 41).  (Note that these totals include all injuries, whether e-coded or not.)  Patient gender was equally distributed overall, although males comprised a slight majority (52%) of those who were hospitalized.  Patients treated in EDs were significantly younger than those who were admitted to hospitals (mean age: 41 vs. 51 years, respectively).  Age was widely distributed for both types of patients, however.  (It was not possible to look at age-specific rate estimates since the age distribution of non-residents is not known.)

*mvc = motor vehicle crash   Falls were by far the leading cause of nonfatal injuries among non-residents who were treated in EDs (31% of 
patients) or who were hospitalized (40%) (Figure 178).  Injuries from being struck by falling objects or by persons were 
the 2nd leading cause of both ED visits (18%) and hospitalizations (8%).  Otherwise, the main causes of injury were dif -
ferent between the two types of patients.  Near drownings (8%), and car crashes (6%) were the next most common causes of injuries requiring hospitalization, while injuries from overexertion (9%), cutting and piercing injuries (7%) and injuries from natural or environmental factors (7%) were more common among patients treated in EDs.

186 Medical char ges for nonfatal injuries among non-residents totaled nearly $30 million each year (Table 42).  Hos -
pitalizations accounted for most (62%) of that total, with an average of nearly $33,000 in medical charges per hospitaliza-
tion.  Over half (60%) of the hospitalized patients had a fracture, with a wide distribution in the anatomical locations of the fractures.  Internal injuries were also relatively common (14%) among hospitalized patients.  Open wounds (28%), contu -
sions and superficial injuries (19%), sprains and strains (16%) and fractures (18%) were the most common types of injuries among non-residents who were treated in EDs.  The incidence of TBI was twice as high among hospitalized patients (17%), compared to those discharged from the ED (8%).

 The previous chapter on 
drownings included only informa-
tion on victims who were residents of Hawaii; this chapter also incor -
porates information from drownings among non-residents.  There were 332 drownings over the 5-year pe-riod, with by far the highest total (79) in 2011 (Figure 179).  The 79 deaths in 2011 was the highest total since at least 1993, surpassing the 2005 total of 77 drownings.  Figure 179 also shows most of the high total in 2011 was due to drownings on Honolulu and Maui counties.  There were 67 drownings on the island of Maui, 3 on Molokai, and 2 on the island of Lanai.  The 332 drownings included 175 (53%) Hawaii residents, and 157 (47%) non-residents.  Most of the non-residents (75%, or 118) were from other U.S. states, with the remaining 39 victims residing in foreign countries.  Figure 179. Annual number of drownings (including non-residents)
 in Hawaii, by county, 2007-2011.
 Drownings occurred among 
victims of all ages, with a large peak of victims in the 45 to 64 year age range (42%, or 140 of the victims) (Figure 180).  Non-resident victims were significantly older, on average, than resident victims (53 vs. 43 years of age), with proportionally more 55 to 74 year-old victims among the former (48% vs. 30% among resi -
dent victims).  Only 55 of the victims (17%) were females; males outnum-bered females by a 5-to-1 ratio.  That gender ratio was closer among the very young and very old victims. Figure 180. Age and gender distribution of drowning victims
 (including non-residents) in Hawaii, 2007-2011.Drownings and Near Drownings

3  Overall, 78% (259) of the drownings occurred in 
the ocean or other saltwater environments (Figure 181), 
although that proportion was significantly higher for non-resident victims (87%), compared to residents (70%).  Drownings in swimming pools (11%, or 36), and rivers and other freshwater bodies (6%, or 21) made up most of the remaining drownings.   There were also 12 victims who drowned in bathtubs and 4 in “other” environments.
 Only 3 (8%) of the 36 victims who drowned in 
swimming pools were under 5 years of age, as victim age was widely distributed in this environment.  There were at least 2 such deaths in each county, although most (75%, or 27) occurred on Oahu.  Nine of these 36 drownings oc -
curred at single family homes, 13 in apartment buildings/condominiums, 11 in hotel pools, and the remaining 3 at community pools.  
Figure 181. Drownings in Hawaii, by environment and residency, 2007-2011. Almost all the 21 freshwater drowning victims 
were young to middle-aged adults; 18 (86%) were 20 to 53 years of age.  These deaths were widely dispersed geographically with county totals varying between 3 to 7 deaths.  However, there were 4 drownings in Kipu Falls on Kauai, 1 each year from 2008 to 2011.  All 7 of the fresh -
water drownings in Hawaii County were in the Hilo area, between the Wailuku River (4 drownings) and Papaikou.  The 12 victims who drowned in bathtubs included 4 (33%) who were under 4 years of age (all of whom were Hawaii residents), and 6 (50%) who were 57 years or older.  All but 1 of the older victims drowned on Oahu.  (The saltwater drownings will be discussed in more detail, including data that was linked to Honolulu County autopsy records from 2007 to 2010.)Drownings and Near Drownings

nificantly lower for Honolulu County 
compared to any other county, for all drownings as well as for those that occurred in saltwater environments (Figure 182).  The highest rates were computed for Kauai, approximately twice as high as rates for Hawaii County and more than 3 times the rates for Honolulu County.  Rates for Hawaii County were intermediate, significantly lower than the rates for Maui (saltwater drownings only) and Kauai counties (either type of drown -
ing).  If all the Neighbor Islands are considered together, the rates of drownings (both total and saltwater) are significantly higher than the rates for Honolulu County. Figure 182. Rate for all types of drownings (left side) 
and for saltwater drownings (right side) in Hawaii, 
by county of injury, 2007-2011.
(Rate is per 100,000 de facto population.  Crude rates are shown, 
unadjusted for age distribution.)
 The most common activity 
among the 259 victims of saltwater drownings was swimming, accounting for almost one quarter (74, or 29%) of the total (Figure 183).  Most of these victims (66%, or 49) were non-resi -
dents.  Snorkeling was the next most common activity (22%, or 57 victims) overall, and the most common activity among non-residents who drowned (51 victims, or 38% of the 136 total non-resident victims).  There were 33 drownings resulting from uninten-tional immersions including people who fell in or were swept in (20), fish -
ing (8) or gathering (3) from shore, or who drowned after boat accidents (2).  Most (76%, or 25) of those 33 victims were residents.  All but 1 of the 24 victims who were free diving were residents, while there were near -
ly equal numbers of residents (5) and non-residents (6) among those who were scuba diving.  Activity could not be determined for 11% (29) of the vic-tims.Figure 183. Ocean drownings in Hawaii, by activity and

(52 of 85) w/intrinsic Autopsy records were reviewed for all but 1 of the 86 saltwater drownings in Honolulu County over the 2007 to 
2010 period.  More than half (61%, or 52) of the 85  ocean drownings were at least somewhat related to intrinsic or personal 
factors among victims (Figure 184).  Intrinsic or personal factors were significantly equally common among resident vic -
tims (60%) and non-residents (63%).  However, non-resident victims were more likely to have had contributing circulatory diseases (55%, vs. 38% for residents), while drownings among residents were more likely to have been drug- or alcohol-related.  Circulatory diseases were the most common type of intrinsic factor, contributing to nearly one-half (46%) of the drownings.  Circulatory diseases were documented for most (69%, or 35 of 51) of victims aged 50 and older, and all 16 of the senior-aged victims.

191 Resident (69 victims) outnumbered non-residents (47 victims) among the 116 ocean drowning victims on Oahu 
from 2007-2011 (Figure 185).  More than half (57%, or 66) of these drownings occurred on the eastern part of the island, 
from Sand Island, around Hanauma and Makapuu to Kailua Bay. There were 8 drownings from Kewalo Basin to the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, including 4 at Ala Moana Beach Park.  Five of these victims were residents.  In contrast, non-resident comprised most (67%, or 12) of the 18 drowning victims in Waikiki (from Hilton Village to Kapahulu Ave.).  All but 1 of the 9 drownings in Hanauma Bay were among non-residents, including 5 among residents of foreign countries, and 3 from other U.S. states.  There were also 6 drownings (including 5 residents) on the eastern end of the island from the Makai Pier to Makapuu Head.  There were 19 drownings along the length of the Waianae Coast, including 5 between Makaha and Pokai Bay Beach Parks, and 10 between Nanakuli and Ko Olina Beach Parks.  The 10 drownings along the North Shore (from Haleiwa to Kahuku Point) included mostly (70%, or 7) residents.  Five of these drownings occurred in 201 1.   
Figure 185. Ocean drownings on Oahu, by residence status of victims, 2007-2011.
Drownings and Near Drownings
192 Residents comprised two-thirds (66%, or 29) of the 44 ocean drowning victims in Hawaii County.  Figure 186 
shows that most (80%, or 12) of the 15 non-resident victims drowned along the western coast, including 6 from Kailua-
Kona to Kahaluu Bay.  All but 1 of the 12 victims who drowned on the eastern part of the island from Hilo to Puna were Hawaii residents.  About three-quarters of the ocean drowning victims on Kauai and Maui counties were non-residents.  Although there were drownings on most parts of Kauai, the 2 biggest concentrations were from Kolopa Cape to Waiohai Beach on the south shore (8 drownings), and from Kee Beach to Kilauea Point on the north coast (15 drownings).  Most (92%, or 57) of the 62 ocean drownings on Maui County were on the island of Maui.  There were 16 drownings (including 15 non-residents) from Kaanapali Beach to Hanakaoo Beach Park on the western coast, including 6 in 2011.  There were 9 drownings (including 8 non-residents) from Makena Bay to Big Beach (Oneloa Beach), and another 4 drownings near Molokini Island.  (The approximate location for five of the drownings could not be determined and therefore do not appear in the Figure: 2 each on Hawaii and Maui counties, and 1 on Kauai.)

193Nonfatal injuries
 Hawaii residents comprised a slight majority (55%) of all patients treated for near drownings, but only 41% of 
those who were hospitalized (Table 43).  There was no clear trend in the annual number of near drownings, which peaked 
in 2008 and 2009.   Male patients outnumbered females by a nearly 3-to-1 ratio for both ED visits and hospitalizations.  There were proportionally more male patients among Hawaii residents (76% of the total), compared to non-residents (68% of whom were males).  ED patients were significantly younger on average than those who were hospitalized (31 vs. 40 years of age), with more than half (56%) in the 15 to 44 year age group.  Only 20% of patients were under 15 years of age.  (It was not possible to look at age-specific rate estimates since the age distribution of non-residents is not known.  This also precludes age-standardized county rate comparisons.)  Hospitalizations for near-drownings were relatively short (4.1 days on average), but the average charge was nearly 17 times higher than that for ED visits.

related to near drownings for the 2010 to 2011 period.  This propor -
tion was significantly greater for ED records (50%) compared to inpatient records (31%).  Records from Kauai hospitals were significantly more likely to contain activity codes (74%, based on only 35 records) compared to hospitals in any other county (33% to 43% of records).  
 Swimming (40%) and “surf -
ing, windsurfing and boogie board -
ing” (32%) were the most common activities for the patients overall, al-though swimming was a more likely cause among non-residents, while the latter activities were more common among residents (Figure 187).  Near drownings related to underwater div-ing and snorkeling were significantly more common among non-residents (22%) compared to residents (4%).  “Surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding” were more common activi-ties for near drownings treated in the ED setting (36%), compared to those requiring hospitalization (20%).  About one-quarter (24%) of the hospitalizations were associated with “underwater diving and snorkeling”, compared to 8% of the ED visits.  Male patients were twice as likely to have been “surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding” (39%), compared to female patients (18%).  Patients who had been “surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding” were significantly older than those who had been swimming (36 vs. 25 years of age, on average), but significantly younger than those who had been “underwater diving and snorkeling” (50 years of age).

7 10 13 14  EMS responded to 921 near drownings over the 5-year period, including 544 (59%) among Hawaii residents and 
377 (41%) non-residents.  (Excluding 41 records for patients with unknown resident status, 18 who were transferred to 
other EMS units (to avoid double-counting of injuries), and 86 patients who were described as dead on arrival.)  These were 896 separate incidents, as 97% involved a single near drowning.  The non-resident group consisted mostly of patients from other United States (82%, or 308), and 69 (18%) residents of foreign countries. 
 Almost all (94%) of the incidents occurred during day time hours, including 80% between 9:31 a.m. and 5:29 p.m. 
(Figure 188).  The most common time for incidents among non-residents was between 9:31 a.m. and 11:29 a.m. (27%), while the peak time for residents was 12:31 p.m. to 4:29 p.m. (46%).  Sunday was the most common day of the week (21%), followed by Saturday (16%); the total varied between 12% and 13% for weekdays.  About 43% of the near drownings occurred in bodies of water, which could include both freshwater and saltwater envi -
ronments.  About one-third (30%) were in patient residences (10%), public buildings (12%), hotels (5%), and health care facilities (3%).  Most (69%, or 36) of the 52 night time incidents occurred in these types of environments.  Another 16% were in “recreation areas”, which could presumably include both indoor and outdoor settings.

196 The distribution of incidents on Oahu was similar to that among Hawaii residents (page 130), with high numbers 
in the Waikiki, North Shore, Hawaii Kai, Ala Moana, and Waianae areas (Figure 189).  The North Kona district again had 
the highest total in Hawaii County, while the incidents on Kauai were widely distributed (Figure 190).  About half (53%) of the incidents on the island of Maui were in the Lahaina district.  There were also 10 incidents on the island of Lanai and 8 on Molokai (not shown on the Figure).

were either transported in “serious” 
(46%) or “critical” (32%) condition (Figure 191).  There were no signifi-cant differences in the distribution of patient condition between residents and non-residents.  Patient condi-tion was not associated with gender, incident location, or the time of day of the near drowning or the day of week.  There was a clear association with patient age, however, as pa-tients who were released at the scene or transported in “minor” condition were significantly younger (31 years, on average) than those transported in “serious” condition (38 years).  The latter were significantly younger than patient who were transported in “critical” condition (47 years, on av-erage). 
 Probable alcohol use was noted for only 4% (33) of the patients.  This proportion did not vary significantly by 
patient gender, residence status, or by county or day of week of incident.  There were also no significant associations be -
tween patient age or disposition and their use of alcohol, although these comparisons are limited by small numbers.  Near drownings  that occurred during night time hours were significantly more likely to involve alcohol consumption than day time incidents, however (21% vs. 3%). Figure 191.

Trauma Registry data
 Only 8% of the adult-aged 
(18 years and older) HTR near drowning patients were positive for alcohol, and only 9% tested positive for illicit drugs, although there was no toxicological testing for about two-thirds of the patients (Figure 192).  Substance use was somewhat higher among resident patients, al -
though this comparison is limited by the small sample sizes and the lack of testing.  Five patients tested positive for narcotics, 4 for THC, and 1 for amphetamines.  Considered together, 14% (12 of 87) of the patients tested positive for either alcohol or drugs.  All 7 of the patients who had used alcohol were males.  Only 3 of these patients had a BAC over 0.08%.  It was not possible to examine the association between alcohol use and risk of mortality since the former was known for only 19% (5) of the 27 patients who ultimately died.  Figure 192.
