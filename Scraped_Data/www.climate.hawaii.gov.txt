The Climate Commission is kicking off the Statewide Climate Action Pathway (CAP) that will help us to achieve our climate goals in a clean and equitable manner. Reaching these goals will require significant societal shifts and so we need your voice to make sure we are uplifting local communities while making a cleaner, more equitable Climate Ready Hawaiʻi. To do this CCMAC is striving to codevelop the CAP with community members building on relationships and networks created during the PCAP planning phase. Community engagement will be particularly focused on ensuring disadvantaged and marginalized communities are included in planning. Engagement will also build a broad coalition of local organizations and leaders to ensure all of our communities are represented. Mahalo for being a part of Hawaiʻi’s climate ready future!

It promotes ambitious, climate-neutral, culturally responsive strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation in a manner that is CLEAN, EQUITABLE, & RESILIENT. Hawaiʻi is a small state with big ambitions and big actions–especially when it comes to addressing climate change. In response to the Paris Agreement , Hawai ʻ i created the Hawaiʻi Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Commission (Commission). The Commission’s priorities are captured in Hawaiʻi’s climate change goals and targets , which can be achieved through high-impact actions . As a member of the U.S. Climate Alliance , we believe that smart, coordinated, data-driven State action can ensure that the U.S. continues to contribute to the global effort to address climate change.
