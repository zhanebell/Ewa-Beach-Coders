2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanLetter from the Director
I am happy to present the 2021–2025 Strategic Plan for the Department of Commerce and Consumer 
Affairs (DCCA) and express my gratitude for all the hard work involved in its development. The plan 
provides a strong and shared vision for DCCA and a path to achieving it.
At this time of COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant economic crisis, DCCA re-affirms its commitment to 
protecting Hawai‘i’s consumers and strengthening the marketplace. Working through the challenges to 
our budget and the working environment, we are finding new ways to serve our community. This Strategic 
Plan outlines how DCCA will confront these challenges and emerge as a more effective and efficient 
agency. 
Highlights of the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan are,
 Technology will play a key role in improving our services and the efficiency with which we deliver 
them,
 For all professionals with the right skills and a spirit of public service, DCCA will strive to be the 
employer-of-choice in Hawai‘i, and towards that end,
 DCCA will embrace workplace flexibility, to be a fully functional agency irrespective of where its 
employees work.
We have an ambitious plan developed through a 10-month collective effort by staff at all levels of DCCA.
I now invite you to join us in making it a reality.
 
 
Sincerely, 
Catherine P . Awakuni Colón

2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanI. Mission and Vision
DCCA is Hawai‘i’s marketplace regulator 
with an experienced leadership team. It 
is known for nimble business regulation, 
strong consumer protection, employee-
friendly practices, and for effectively 
leveraging technology for internal 
efficiency and customer convenience.To protect Hawai‘i’s consumers 
and service its business 
community with respect and 
fairness to the interests of both.MISSION
VISION 20256
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanII. 2021-2025 Strategic Plan
Purpose
Process
PrioritiesThis strategic plan affirms DCCA’s mission, estab -
lishes the vision for what it aspires to be by the end 
of the year 2025. It also identifies specific steps 
DCCA intends to take in order to fulfill that vision.
DCCA oversees and regulates Hawai‘i’s marketplace 
with numerous responsibilities to protect consum -
ers and establish standards for businesses to op -
erate in.  The State of Hawai‘i consolidates a wider 
range of responsibilities under DCCA’s authority 
than do most other states, which tend to distribute 
them among different agencies. This strategic plan 
focuses on the most essential needs for organiza-
tional alignment.We conducted five focus group discussions at 
branch chief and non-supervisory staff levels to 
hear perspectives on, among other things — What 
is working well and what isn’t? What is urgent? 
What needs sustained attention?  What are the 
root causes of various issues? How can operations 
be improved?
In addition, we gathered feedback from outside 
partners, like the Gartner Group (for technolo-
gy-related issues) and the Blue Zones program (for 
employee wellness). Information from this pro-
cess was used to develop a comprehensive set of 
Findings, Observations, and Recommendations for 
consideration by DCCA in the future (see Appen -
dix).  The most important priorities are identified 
in the section below.
This strategic plan is the product of a ten-month 
effort facilitated by Keith Mattson, Iqbal Ashraf, 
Peter Adler and Frank Haas from GUILD Consulting. 
It built upon a prior internal effort by DCCA Division 
Chiefs. The project involved all levels of DCCA’s 
workforce and a few outside partners.  In addition 
to independent research, we sought input from a 
wide range of individuals in leadership, supervisory, 
and non-supervisory roles.
We sent a comprehensive survey to all DCCA 
employees (with responses from 320 employees) 
to collect confidential opinions about key aspects 
of the Department’s operations and work environ-
ment.The plan identifies the “critical few” priorities need -
ed to achieve DCCA’s 2025 vision.  While individ -
ual units within DCCA may have their own unique 
priorities based on their specific roles and responsi -
bilities, these four DCCA “objectives” cut across all 
functions, divisions and branches.  
Further, every unit within DCCA should align its pri -
orities to these overarching objectives, and at the 
very minimum avoid efforts which may run counter 
to these objectives. This will strengthen DCCA’s 
status as a single department, not just a collection 
of various divisions and branches.7
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBJECTIVE 1
Accessible data across 
DCCA
OBJECTIVE 3
Recruit and retain top 
performers at DCCA
OBJECTIVE 4
Make DCCA a fully 
functional agency regardless 
of where staff worksOBJECTIVE 2
Implement technology 
roadmap for DCCADCCA Divisions collect information on organizations 
and individuals doing business in Hawai‘i.  
Oftentimes these are overseen by different DCCA 
Divisions for different purposes, based on the 
nature of their commercial activities. DCCA seeks 
to eliminate the need for the regulated entity to 
resubmit same information to different units within 
DCCA.  Similarly, when the entity is flagged “out 
of compliance” by one division, it likely needs to 
be immediately flagged as such by other relevant 
divisions as well. The ability for different DCCA 
divisions to have real-time, shared, secure access to 
such entity data will make oversight more customer-
friendly, efficient and effective.Fulfilling the Department’s many responsibilities 
requires hundreds of dedicated professionals with 
specialized expertise.  There are many challenges 
to building and maintaining such a workforce, 
particularly when DCCA competes with the private 
sector and local government to hire and retain 
top specialized talent.   DCCA must develop more 
effective means for recruiting and retaining the 
types of talented workers it needs to fulfill its 
mission and vision.
Overnight, COVID has turned working from home 
from a broadly-felt staff aspiration into a full-fledged 
necessity. While DCCA did well executing this 
transition on an interim basis, there are many issues 
yet to be resolved.  The ability for each employee 
to do their job effectively irrespective of whether 
they are working from home or in the office will 
make DCCA’s workforce, its various divisions and 
its services more resilient.  It will also make DCCA a 
more attractive employer.applications and establish clear technology 
roadmap and policies aligned to its overall vision. 
This needs to be a department-wide collaborative 
effort facilitated by the Information Systems and 
Communication Office (ISCO).
DCCA’s technology footprint has grown organically 
over time largely due to autonomous efforts 
by its various units.  The policies for acquiring, 
maintaining, changing and decommissioning 
applications are largely undefined. The support for 
current applications and projects related to these 
applications is not optimized for department-wide 
effectiveness.  This leads to avoidable errors, user 
frustration and haphazard efforts by scarce IT 
personnel.  Moreover, with increasing complexity 
and organizational needs this approach is no longer 
sustainable.  To begin the process to strategically 
leverage the power of technology, the department 
first needs to clearly understand its current8 9

2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanAPPENDIX C: Findings
Introduction
This document is the synthesis of GUILD Consulting’s research, surveys, interviews, focus group meetings 
and other interactions with DCCA staff at all levels over the last nine months. It also incorporates our 
understanding of the implications of the COVID-19 crisis. It is intended to share with the DCCA management 
team what we find pertinent to strategic planning for the next five years.
Key Assumptions
1. The complexity and frequency of change with respect to consumer scams, technology developments, and 
regulatory demands will increase in the future.
2. Budget cuts will force DCCA to prioritize current services and be selective about new initiatives.
3. DCCA’s response to COVID-19 has ushered in an entirely new approach to remote working situations.  It is 
unlikely that policies and practices regarding work environments will revert to pre-COVID conditions.
4. COVID-19 offers a unique opportunity to mobilize the entire department to eliminate non-essential work, 
adapt to meet customer expectations, and drive transformative change on how work gets done. 14
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanSTRENGTHS
OPPORTUNITIESWEAKNESSES
THREATS1. Committed employees
2. Knowledgeable top and 2nd level managers
3. Healthy workplace environment (now 
bolstered by Blue Zones)
4. Department leadership committed to agency 
improvement
1. Leveraging AI to drive efficiency (e.g. flagging 
issues, automated filings)
2. New pathways for hiring: internships, higher-
ed programs, fast-tracking based on merit
3. Sustainability (State moving to adopt U.N. 
Sustainable Development Goals)
4. Public-private-partnerships
5. Enhanced consumer awareness (e.g., social 
media, PSAs)1. Loss of key staff with subject matter 
expertise
2. Inefficient communication and workflows 
(e.g. investigation, budgeting)
3. Inconsistent processes 
4. Broken hiring processes
5. Lack of IT integration (e.g. shared data) and 
standardization across divisions 
6. DCCA website is not a 1-stop shop for 
all information and services (e.g. ny.gov/
services)
1. Budget cuts
2. Experienced staff departures
3. Outdated statutes and risks of introducing 
new legislation, uninformed legislative 
changes
4. Rapid changes (tech, society)
5. Vulnerable consumer populations (e.g., 
elderly, non-English speaking)15
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBSERVATION 1:  
COVID-19 illuminated strengths and weaknesses 
at DCCA and will change the way the department 
conducts its operations for the foreseeable future  
Context:
1. Some units had a comfortable transition to work-from-home, while others struggled due to a few basic 
factors (e.g. access to computer). Overall, we believe DCCA fared better than most state departments.
2. IT staff were quick and creative in coping with the immediate needs for working from home.  However, 
several processes need to be redesigned for remote work and reduced face to face interactions going 
forward (e.g., site inspections, public hearings, remote use of office phones, access to secure files, use of 
printers, etc.).
3. Employee morale appears to have improved during work-from-home. However, it is uncertain if employee 
morale will change or remain the same if employees continue working from home on a long-term basis.
Recommendations: 
1. DCCA needs to expand digital and remote-service capabilities.  This will require new hardware, software and 
training (e.g. for employees who need to call consumers back using a business phone or a software solution 
which prevents their personal phone number being displayed to the consumer).
2. DCCA needs to address specific issues that employees face when working from home and/or at other 
locations outside DCCA offices, such as during site inspections.  These include developing better ways to 
collaborate using audio, video, and data transmissions). 
3. Simple ‘remote work capability’ assessments should be done for each employee’s ability to perform their 
job from home or other non-DCCA office location.  The assessments should be standardized and capable of 
rolling up to indicate unit-wide capabilities and needs.  
4. Management of remote staff requires a new approach. Sharing of best practices between units will help. 
Managing for results (vs. monitoring staff efforts) will be more effective.
5. Priorities identified through the strategic planning process will likely need a phased execution plan that 
accounts for COVID-related urgency and uncertainties.16
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBSERVATION 2:  
DCCA divisions and branches are siloed 
Context:
1. Some of this is unavoidable due to the broad scope of specialized services and interactions with consumers, 
professionals and enterprises. DCCA has broader responsibilities than similar agencies in several other 
states.
2. There is a natural tendency to orient around business-facing vs. consumer-facing perspectives and 
communications.
3. Specialized experience and job requirements make it more difficult to move people between divisions.
4. Different units have different technology solutions, workflows, and oversight bodies which further 
entrenches the siloes.
5. Ineffective management practices, for example where managers prevent direct interactions between their 
staff in their absence, or micromanage their employees, make cross-unit collaboration difficult. 
Recommendations: 
1. Certain cross-department policies and practices can play important unifying roles, such as Information 
Technology integration, the Blue Zones program, enhanced intra-DCCA communications, and creating 
a more robust single government-to-customer communication platform (e.g., as DCCA, not as separate 
divisions). 
2. Cross-division teams can be formed to address specific common challenges and needs, such as improved 
hiring practices, internship programs, social media presence, etc.
OBSERVATION 3:  
DCCA has chronic staffing problems, and many other 
issues stem from this root cause  
Context:
1. The current hiring process has serious flaws, especially in the way DCCA works with DHRD. There appears to 
be little to no meaningful engagement between DCCA and DHRD at operational levels, which leads to a poor 
understanding of each other’s processes and practices.17
2021 – 2025 Strategic Plan2. There is an absence of accelerated career pathways (such as from intern to investigator).
3. Newcomers lament the absence of merit-based recognition (vs. ‘seniority-based’ benefits).
4. DCCA has lower pay versus private sector entities, and federal and city & county agencies.
5. New employee training is lacking, leading to stress and inconsistent work output (e.g. approach to 
investigations, how to testify in hearings).
6. There is insufficient supervisory training that leads to avoidable and recurring personnel issues.
7. Some supervisors are poor delegators. This leads to hoarding of work and bottlenecks in communication. 
Unfilled positions make such bottlenecks significantly worse.
8. Gaps in management staffing puts burdens on other managers and supervisors.  This prevents moving past 
‘putting out fires’ to deal proactively with issues.
Recommendations: 
1. We understand this hiring challenge with DHRD exists beyond DCCA. We should investigate what 
workarounds have others agencies developed to address their hiring needs.
2. DCCA managers with hiring needs should develop a better understanding of DHRD personnel and protocols, 
and solidify a strong working relationship with them. Chronic impasses between DHRD and DCCA should be 
addressed at leadership levels and, in some cases, use joint-agency cross functional teams.
3. Implement succession planning in a phased manner, starting with critical roles.
4. Job descriptions need to be updated to incorporate the new skills needed to succeed at DCCA.
5. Establish guidelines for minimum training that each new employee should receive during onboarding.
6. Train new and existing employees on soft skills/customer service.
7. Train supervisors in managerial and communication skills to minimize persistent personnel conflicts.18
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBSERVATION 4:  
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and best 
practices need to be established in several areas
Context:
1. Statutes have often not kept up with environment changes, such as new technologies and techniques. Staff 
seek leadership “cover” and legal assurances to make decisions that can’t be clearly based on statutes.  
2. Past DCCA decisions are not easily accessible for reference via a “knowledge bank”. This leads to several 
“grey areas” where junior staff routinely seek guidance from supervisors, rather than from precedent. The 
absence of SOPs requires them to elevate matters to higher levels, leading to serious inefficiencies and 
service delays.
3. There appears to be inadequate and inconsistent delegation of decision making in certain divisions.
4. Resolution of uncertain situations is often determined by individual management personalities.  New 
supervisors and chiefs can cause disruption and uncertainty. More needs to be done to establish clarity and 
consistency.
5. Complex and important decisions are sometimes based on “chain of command” protocols, without due 
regard to relevant expertise and collaborative problem solving.  Key information can be lost or misinterpreted 
going up and down the “chain”.  
6. The new department-wide payment system has improved operations, but other systems need updating (e.g. 
travel approvals, procurement).
7. Some legacy protocols and practices need a fresh look (e.g., RICO does case intake for OCP).
Recommendations: 
1. Developing SOPs, starting with the most critical processes or areas where there is an imminent risk of loss 
of subject matter expertise, will create stability, increase delegation and improve efficiency. It will also ease 
the way for automation.  SOPs should be firmly rooted in past actions but with flexibility to address new 
situations.  SOPs should be a foundation for new employee training.
2. The management mindset needs to move from “total risk prevention” to “sensible risk management”. 
Priorities need to be set to strike a better balance between seeking an optimal but unattainable risk-free 
environment and enabling efficient workflows.
3. DCCA should consider establishing thresholds of risk for different decision-making situations.  This could 
provide clarity and direction for greater delegation of decision making.19
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBSERVATION 5:  
DCCA’s focus on employee wellness is appreciated but 
needs adjustments
OBSERVATION 6:  
IT integration is important but requires careful 
thought and executionContext:
1. Employees value the Blue Zones program and recognize that DCCA is a trailblazer.
2. Employees need to better understand the goals and agenda of Blue Zones.
3. Blue Zones activities scheduled during lunch hours prevents many from participating.  Employees in the State 
Office Building on Beretania have to walk to attend events at the main DCCA building. Likewise, in neighbor 
island units, the Blue Zones activities are limited.  
4. Online Blue Zones activities with archived sessions are popular.  Topics that help DCCA employees deal with 
different life experiences such as elder caregiving appear to be especially valued.
Recommendations:
1. Communicate clearly and widely why DCCA has implemented Blue Zones.
2. Continue with online and recorded Blue Zones activities.
3. Consider holding some Blue Zones activities during work hours.
4. Broaden the range of Blue Zones activities to address critical employee needs, such as care giving, stress 
management, and social isolation due to remote working.
Context:
1. Information technology improvements and integration are ubiquitously recognized as essential to making 
DCCA more efficient and effective.
2. Lots of redundant data in various units.20
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanOBSERVATION 7:  
IT can help improve service delivery and consumer 
outreach
Context:
1. There is a widespread desire to make it easier for consumers to receive information and help from DCCA and 
an acknowledgment that some processes are needlessly complex.
2. DCCA (unlike peers in many other states) has the challenge of serving diverse communities across islands, 
speaking different non-English languages and having non-uniform access to basic technology.3. Lack of integration exposes inconsistent treatment of different DCCA customers.
4. If DCCA automates its existing processes, there is a risk of technology “hard coding” inefficiencies and 
inconsistencies in workflow.
5. The ability to fully implement IT solutions will depend on other entities’ practices (e.g., may be forced to 
accommodate ‘lowest common denominator).
6. Unfulfilled promises in the past have led to some staff cynicism (e.g. the goal of a paperless office).
7. AI offers a new opportunity to improve quality and efficiency (flag alerts, automate simple filings).
Recommendations:
1. DCCA needs an architecture which balances unique needs of individual units with standardization and 
efficiency needs of the whole department.
2. Technology implementation should be done with proper thought to business process improvement and 
change management. DCCA needs process improvement, project management and change management to 
reduce risks in its internal IT/modernization initiatives.
3. IT integration needs to allow for division-level flexibility since there are various types of customers that DCCA 
serves.
4. IT integration needs to fully support remote working needs, such as access to secure files.21
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanRecommendations:
1. Develop a single window to all DCCA services available in multiple languages (for e.g. ny.gov/services).
2. Create better consumer self-service modules for simple needs (for e.g. accessing reports or past decisions).
3. Develop multi-lingual consumer outreach campaigns on different popular platforms (e.g., Facebook).
4. Develop new Public-Private-Partnerships to expand community reach.
OBSERVATION 8:  
DCCA lacks the foundational elements to drive 
continuous improvement
Context:
1. There is no systemic way to capture consumer feedback on DCCA’s performance.
2. There appears to be no internal, department-wide ‘process improvement team’.
3. We are not aware of any consistently administered employee exit assessments.
4. We are not aware of any department-wide performance dashboard.
5. Some employees feel insecure about raising concerns or suggestions.
Recommendations:
1. DCCA should develop standard ways to capture consumer feedback, such as post-transaction surveys or 
periodic customer satisfaction surveys.
2. DCCA should form different cross-functional ‘process improvement teams’ to identify and address 
inefficiencies/red tape, unnecessary actions, improved procedures, etc.
3. DCCA should conduct regular employee surveys, beyond Blue Zones and this Strategic Planning exercise.
4. DCCA leadership should consider holding regular group dialogues with different staff levels to gather insight 
and feedback on specific issues.
5. Enhance ways to provide employee feedback to management (e.g., anonymous suggestion box, all hands 
sessions, etc.).22
2021 – 2025 Strategic PlanDisconnects
While we found a great deal of congruence about most issues, there were a few areas disagreement:
1. The survey revealed that two-thirds of employees felt that customers are served ‘extremely or fairly well’. 
However, management perceives that there are serious service quality gaps.
2. There is disagreement among supervisors and non-supervisors about the “level of bureaucracy” in DCCA. 
Nearly half of non-supervisory staff feel bureaucracy is one of the “least enjoyable” aspects of their job. On 
the other hand, supervisors don’t feel bureaucracy is a significant issue.
Other thoughts
In addition to the recommendations listed under our eight observations, we also recommend the following be 
considered:
1. Start a leadership program to rotate high-potential employees through various divisions, at the end of which 
they are ready to lead with a more holistic perspective about DCCA’s mission and purpose.
2. Initiate occasional feedback sessions for management and relatively new employees on DCCA-related topics 
(e.g., better ways to educate consumers) and/or how things might be done differently at DCCA.
3. Establish a service desk “ticketing system” to standardize workflows and improve tracking, closure and 
reporting of standard service requests.
4. A learning management system (LMS) can be piloted in one division for training new employees and 
expanded department-wide for all training needs.
5. Lay the groundwork to develop an appointed ‘Council for Regulatory Changes’ to depoliticize the legislative 
process, as the Council on Revenues has done for budgeting. https://tax.hawaii.gov/useful/a9_1cor/ 
6. Offer specific business and consumer guidance relative to the pandemic on DCCA’s website. For e.g. https://
www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/COVID196. Conduct leadership team reviews of feedback/recommendations on a monthly or quarterly basis.
7. Establish project management best practices to provide guidance for implementing new initiatives.
8. Establish a high-level performance dashboard to regularly review critical metrics (e.g. job vacancies, or 
response times and accuracy of customer service), various leading indicators, and progress of ongoing major 
projects and initiatives.
9. Establish best practices for managing employee exits, starting with top management exits and exits of 
internal experts due to retirement to ensure organizational stability. 23
