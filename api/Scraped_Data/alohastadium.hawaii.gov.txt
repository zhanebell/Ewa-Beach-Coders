There is no greater place than the Aloha Stadium! ALOHA FROM ALOHA STADIUM CLOSING EVENT AND ACTIVITIES TRIBUTE As the historic facility evolves into a new Stadium, on Saturday, February 25, 2023 the community was given one last chance to tour the facility and visit unseen areas usually not available to the public. Thousands of Kama’aina and fans from all around the world enjoyed activities and shared memories of this iconic stadium. Click the link above for photos of the event.
