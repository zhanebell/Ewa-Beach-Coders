PREMIUM CONVERSION PLAN 
PLAN DOCUMENT -FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE OF HAWAII 
INTRODUCTION 
The State of Hawaii ’s ("State ") Premium 
Conversion Plan ( "PCP" or " Plan ") 
provides an opportunity to most health 
benefits plan participants to save some tax 
dollars and make the most of their 
paychecks. It is being offered pursuant to 
HRS c hapter 78, and within the meaning of 
Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 (" Code "), as amended, relating to 
“cafeteria plans”. 
To retain this benefit, the State must 
administer the Plan in strict compliance 
with the Hawaii PCP Administrative Rules 
14-51 (“Rules ”). It is important to read this 
Plan Document thoroughly. Carefully weigh 
the Plan’s effect on your social security 
benefits. You may want to consult with a 
tax advisor to help determine whether this 
Plan will benefit you. 
Please keep in mind that this is only a 
summary of HRS c hapter 14 -51, “Premium 
Conversion Plan” , and is not the complete 
text. In all cases where a question arises, 
the Rules will govern. The Rules may be 
examined, or a copy may be obtained by 
contacting: 
Director of Human Resources 
Development (DHRD)
PCP Administrator 
235 S. Beretania St., 14th Floor 
Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 
Or, visit the DHRD website at: 
dhrd.hawaii.gov/administrative -rules/ 
This Plan Document sets forth the 
material features of the Plan in a question 
and answer format. 
1. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF 
THIS PLAN? 
When you enroll in this Plan, your 
income will be taxed after your health 
benefits contributions are deducted, so 
your take -home pay should be greater than 
if you do not enroll . 
2. WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS 
PLAN? 
You are eligible to participate in the Plan 
if you are an employee of the State and 
enrolled in any health benefits plan offered 
through the Hawaii Employer -Union Health 
Benefits Trust Fund ("EUTF ") and your 
payroll deductions are processed through 
the Department of Accounting and General 
Services . 
3. HOW DOES THE PLAN WORK? 
When you enroll in this Plan: 
♦ You authorize the State to reduce 
your gross salary (before federal, State, 
and social security taxes are 
calculated) by the total amount of your 
health benefits plan contributions ; and $2,000 
PCP Reduction 
Gross Taxable $2,000 
Federal Tax withheld 
State Tax withheld $88 
FICA Tax withheld 
Health Insurance $267 
Vision Care 
Dental Insurance $13

Take -home pay $1274.40 
Gross Pay $2,000

I I ♦ The result is that your take -home pay is 
likely to increase since you will pay less 
federal income, State income , and 
FICA taxes. 
Let’s look at a hypothetical example to 
show how the Plan would increase the 
take-home pay of an employee: this 
employee earns a gross pay of $ 2,000.00 
per semi -month ly pay period , is married, 
claims zero exemptions, and enrolled in 
two-party health plans requiring a total 
employee contribution of $ 283.00 per 
semi -monthly pay period: 
NOT enrolled in PCP 
Gross Pay 
0 
$101.60 
$153 
$3 
$100 
Enrolled in PCP 
$283 
$73.30 
$131.36 
0 
$100 
Take -home pay $1342.46 
In this example, take -home pay will be 
$68.06 more per pay period , or $ 1633.44 
more per year if this employee enrolled in 
the PCP. (Calculations may vary-example 
based on 2019 withholding tables ). 
Please note that the above example was 
based on an employee who is married . If 
you cover your domestic or civil union 
partner under your health plan, there may 
be other tax liabilities in connection with 
your domestic or civil union partner's 
coverage, such that the tax savings benefit 
of enrolling in the PCP may be minimal. 
Therefore, you may want to consult with a 
tax advisor prior to enrolling in the Plan. 
4. HOW AND WHEN CAN I ENROLL IN 
THIS PLAN? 
New Employees -If you are a new 
employee, you may enroll in the Plan when 
you become eligible to enroll in any of the 
eligible health benefits plans. Normally, this 
is within ninety (90) calendar days of the 
date you were hired. If you do not enroll 
during this 90 -day eligibility period or you 
elected not to enroll at the time you 
completed your new hire paperwork, you 
will not be able to enroll in the Plan until 
the following Plan year unless you are 
permitted under the Rules to enroll. 
Employees wishing to enroll in PCP, 
shall make their selection by completing 
the New Hire/Newly Eligible event in the EUTF Member Self -Service Portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and submit it to the 
Human Resources Office (HRO) designee . 
Current Employees -If you are a current 
employee and do not enroll before the Plan 
year begins, you will have to wait until the 
following Plan year to enroll. The only 
exception to this rule occurs in the case 
where you are permitted under the Rules 
to change from an election of no health 
benefits plan coverage to an election for 
such coverage. 
For example , if you previously did not 
take medical coverage through the State 
because you were covered under your 
spouse’s medical plan, and your spouse 
dies or loses their job, you would be 
eligible to obtain medical coverage through 
the State , and you may also be eligible to 
enroll in the PCP. You must, however, 
complete the applicabl e event change in 
the EUTF Member Self -Service Portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and file the appropriate 
forms with your HRO designee within 
ninety ( 90) calendar days of the event 
giving rise to your eligibility to enroll. 
Open Enrollment -Employees may enroll, 
make changes to , or cancel their existing 
enrollment without experiencing a 
qualifying change in status event during 
this designated time period . Employees 
wishing to enroll in, change, or cancel their 
PCP enrollment shall make their selection 
by completing the Open Enrollment event 
in the EUTF Member Self -Service portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and submit it to their HRO 
designee no later than the end of the Open 
Enro llment period. 
The Plan Year normally runs from July 1 
to June 30 each year. 
5. HOW CAN I CHANGE MY PCP 
ELECTION? 
Your PCP authorization and election will 
be automatically renew ed each Plan year . 
If you wish to change your election, you 
can only do so during a designated Open 
Enrollment period. The only exception is if 
a change in your status has occurred for 
which the Rules permit a PCP election

 Your marriage, divorce , or marriage 
annulment. 
 Birth, adoption, or placement for 
adoption of a child or addition of a 
foster child.

  Start or return from an (authorized)

are likely to lose. To avoid this, file in a 
timely manner . you continued your health benefits plan 
coverage during your leave by making the 
required out -of-pocket contributions. 
If your health benefits coverage was 
cancelled because you did not make the 
required out -of-pocket contributions while

Section 152 of the Code and qualifies as 
your dependent for federal income tax 
purposes, you may deduct the entire

PCP? 
Usually , you will not lose money by 
enrolling in the PCP. However, if you

Rules , your PCP election will continue, and While you are on an authorized leave 
without pay ("LWOP "), out-of-pocket

continue your health benefits plan

PREMIUM CONVERSION PLAN 
PLAN DOCUMENT -FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE OF HAWAII 
INTRODUCTION 
The State of Hawaii ’s ("State ") Premium 
Conversion Plan ( "PCP" or " Plan ") 
provides an opportunity to most health 
benefits plan participants to save some tax 
dollars and make the most of their 
paychecks. It is being offered pursuant to 
HRS c hapter 78, and within the meaning of 
Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 (" Code "), as amended, relating to 
“cafeteria plans”. 
To retain this benefit, the State must 
administer the Plan in strict compliance 
with the Hawaii PCP Administrative Rules 
14-51 (“Rules ”). It is important to read this 
Plan Document thoroughly. Carefully weigh 
the Plan’s effect on your social security 
benefits. You may want to consult with a 
tax advisor to help determine whether this 
Plan will benefit you. 
Please keep in mind that this is only a 
summary of HRS c hapter 14 -51, “Premium 
Conversion Plan” , and is not the complete 
text. In all cases where a question arises, 
the Rules will govern. The Rules may be 
examined, or a copy may be obtained by 
contacting: 
Director of Human Resources 
Development (DHRD)
PCP Administrator 
235 S. Beretania St., 14th Floor 
Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 
Or, visit the DHRD website at: 
dhrd.hawaii.gov/administrative -rules/ 
This Plan Document sets forth the 
material features of the Plan in a question 
and answer format. 
1. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF 
THIS PLAN? 
When you enroll in this Plan, your 
income will be taxed after your health 
benefits contributions are deducted, so 
your take -home pay should be greater than 
if you do not enroll . 
2. WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS 
PLAN? 
You are eligible to participate in the Plan 
if you are an employee of the State and 
enrolled in any health benefits plan offered 
through the Hawaii Employer -Union Health 
Benefits Trust Fund ("EUTF ") and your 
payroll deductions are processed through 
the Department of Accounting and General 
Services . 
3. HOW DOES THE PLAN WORK? 
When you enroll in this Plan: 
♦ You authorize the State to reduce 
your gross salary (before federal, State, 
and social security taxes are 
calculated) by the total amount of your 
health benefits plan contributions ; and $2,000 
PCP Reduction 
Gross Taxable $2,000 
Federal Tax withheld 
State Tax withheld $88 
FICA Tax withheld 
Health Insurance $267 
Vision Care 
Dental Insurance $13

I I ♦ The result is that your take -home pay is 
likely to increase since you will pay less 
federal income, State income , and 
FICA taxes. 
Let’s look at a hypothetical example to 
show how the Plan would increase the 
take-home pay of an employee: this 
employee earns a gross pay of $ 2,000.00 
per semi -month ly pay period , is married, 
claims zero exemptions, and enrolled in 
two-party health plans requiring a total 
employee contribution of $ 283.00 per 
semi -monthly pay period: 
NOT enrolled in PCP 
Gross Pay 
0 
$101.60 
$153 
$3 
$100 
Enrolled in PCP 
$283 
$73.30 
$131.36 
0 
$100 
Take -home pay $1342.46 
In this example, take -home pay will be 
$68.06 more per pay period , or $ 1633.44 
more per year if this employee enrolled in 
the PCP. (Calculations may vary-example 
based on 2019 withholding tables ). 
Please note that the above example was 
based on an employee who is married . If 
you cover your domestic or civil union 
partner under your health plan, there may 
be other tax liabilities in connection with 
your domestic or civil union partner's 
coverage, such that the tax savings benefit 
of enrolling in the PCP may be minimal. 
Therefore, you may want to consult with a 
tax advisor prior to enrolling in the Plan. 
4. HOW AND WHEN CAN I ENROLL IN 
THIS PLAN? 
New Employees -If you are a new 
employee, you may enroll in the Plan when 
you become eligible to enroll in any of the 
eligible health benefits plans. Normally, this 
is within ninety (90) calendar days of the 
date you were hired. If you do not enroll 
during this 90 -day eligibility period or you 
elected not to enroll at the time you 
completed your new hire paperwork, you 
will not be able to enroll in the Plan until 
the following Plan year unless you are 
permitted under the Rules to enroll. 
Employees wishing to enroll in PCP, 
shall make their selection by completing 
the New Hire/Newly Eligible event in the EUTF Member Self -Service Portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and submit it to the 
Human Resources Office (HRO) designee . 
Current Employees -If you are a current 
employee and do not enroll before the Plan 
year begins, you will have to wait until the 
following Plan year to enroll. The only 
exception to this rule occurs in the case 
where you are permitted under the Rules 
to change from an election of no health 
benefits plan coverage to an election for 
such coverage. 
For example , if you previously did not 
take medical coverage through the State 
because you were covered under your 
spouse’s medical plan, and your spouse 
dies or loses their job, you would be 
eligible to obtain medical coverage through 
the State , and you may also be eligible to 
enroll in the PCP. You must, however, 
complete the applicabl e event change in 
the EUTF Member Self -Service Portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and file the appropriate 
forms with your HRO designee within 
ninety ( 90) calendar days of the event 
giving rise to your eligibility to enroll. 
Open Enrollment -Employees may enroll, 
make changes to , or cancel their existing 
enrollment without experiencing a 
qualifying change in status event during 
this designated time period . Employees 
wishing to enroll in, change, or cancel their 
PCP enrollment shall make their selection 
by completing the Open Enrollment event 
in the EUTF Member Self -Service portal at 
eutfbenefits.hawaii.gov or in the Plan 
Selection section of the EUTF’s EC -1 or 
EC-1H (for HSTA VB members only) 
Enrollment Form and submit it to their HRO 
designee no later than the end of the Open 
Enro llment period. 
The Plan Year normally runs from July 1 
to June 30 each year. 
5. HOW CAN I CHANGE MY PCP 
ELECTION? 
Your PCP authorization and election will 
be automatically renew ed each Plan year . 
If you wish to change your election, you 
can only do so during a designated Open 
Enrollment period. The only exception is if 
a change in your status has occurred for 
which the Rules permit a PCP election

 Your marriage, divorce , or marriage 
annulment. 
 Birth, adoption, or placement for 
adoption of a child or addition of a 
foster child.

  Start or return from an (authorized) 
unpaid leave of absence. To ensure that your forfeitures are stopped

are likely to lose. To avoid this, file in a 
timely manner . you continued your health benefits plan 
coverage during your leave by making the 
required out -of-pocket contributions. 
If your health benefits coverage was 
cancelled because you did not make the 
required out -of-pocket contributions while 
you were on a LWOP , your PCP election 
will likewise be cancelled as of the same 
effective date.

7. CAN I LOSE MONEY UNDER THE 
PCP? 
Usually , you will not lose money by 
enrolling in the PCP. However, if you 
change/cancel your health benefits plan 
coverage but your PCP change/ 
cancellation is not permissible under the 
Rules , your PCP election will continue, and While you are on an authorized leave 
without pay ("LWOP "), out-of-pocket 
employee contributions that you pay to 
continue your health benefits plan 
coverage cannot be applied for PCP 
purposes. This is because these payments 
are made outside of the State’s payroll 
system and do not qualify for the tax 
savings avail able under the Plan. Revised: March 2024
