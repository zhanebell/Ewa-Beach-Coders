The partnership between the Hawai’i State Archives, ‘Ukulele Foundation of Hawai’i, Ukulele Hall of Fame Museum, ‘Ukulele Guild of Hawai’i, Kealakai Center for Pacific Strings, Honokaʻupu ‘Ukulele Collection and Line Studio is international in scope, reflecting the lasting popularity of the ‘ukulele and Hawaiian music around the world. Much of the material in the archives–which already includes tens of thousands of music recordings, hundreds of historic ‘ukulele, sheet music, photographs, and the personal papers of key figures in Hawaiian music–was previously locked away in private collections.
