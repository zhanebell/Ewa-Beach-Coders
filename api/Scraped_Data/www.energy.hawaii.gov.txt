The State of Hawai‘i has a bold energy agenda — to achieve 100 percent clean energy by the year 2045. Along with reducing our islands’ dependency on fossil fuels and increasing efficiency measures, the clean energy plan is also contributing to the state’s economic growth. Because Hawai‘i is committed to re-powering the clean energy market, we have embraced bold solutions that will help develop this competitive industry, making Hawai‘i one of the leaders in the clean energy race. The Hawai‘i State Energy Office leads statewide energy security and resilience initiatives while catalyzing energy independence and decarbonization. Hawai‘i’s ENERGY Story Life on the Hawaiian archipelago has been shaped by elemental energy sources — wind, water, earth, sun, moon, and sky. The Hawaiian creation story told through the Kumulipo tells of the interconnected relationship between humankind and nature. An ancestral link to nature’s life-giving and life-sustaining energy is a core feature of the Hawaiian cultural value system. We often see it expressed through mālama ‘āina: the care and stewardship of the environment and natural resources. Energy is a shared natural resource that connects us to the past and provides our foundation for the future. HSEO fulfills its mission to residents through strategy and thought leadership; program design and implementation; analysis, reporting, and data collection and sharing; regulatory support; and education, outreach, and community/public engagement. decarbonIZATION Act 238, Session Laws of Hawai’i 2022, tasks the Hawai‘i State Energy Office to “analyze pathways and develop recommendations for achieving the State’s economy-wide decarbonization goals.” Additionally, the study evaluates emission reduction pathways from all emitting sectors economy-wide. Pursuant to Hawai’i Revised Statutes §225P-5, Hawai’i has a target “to sequester more atmospheric carbon and greenhouse gases than emitted within the State as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045”, effectively establishing a net-negative emissions target.

Hawai‘i’s peopl e and economy rely on energy for everything 
from fuel for cars an d airp lanes t o electricit y for lights, 
wate r, ventilation, c ooling , heating, c omputers , cooking, 
communication , security, a nd m yriad other uses. 
Thes e energ y needs a re me t by a combination o f renewable 
and n on-renewable e nergy s ources, as s hown in Figur e 1. 
According t o data f rom the U nited S tates Energy 
Information Administration, in 2018 (the most recent year 
for which complete data is available) Hawai‘i’s energy 
needs were met by: 
•31.109 trillion British thermal units (Btu) equivalent o f
re
newable energy ;
•14
.367 trillion Btu of coal ;
•0.
192 trillion Btu of natural gas; an d
•2
47.227 trillion Btu of petroleum products (thi s
in
cludes jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, naphtha, an d
o
ther distillates).1 
Many p eople are n ot aw are o f the relative ly large q uantities, 
expens e, and emissions f rom th ese impor ted fuels . The 
amount o f fuel i mported i nto Hawaiʻi exceeds th e amoun t of 
any other product imported i nto the state. A 2019 study 
showed that Hawai ‘i’s imports of more than six million tons 
of petroleum, petroleum products, and coal were 57 percent of the total tons of cargo imports through ports i n Hawai‘ i, 
and exc eeded th e import s of all other p roducts a nd 
materials i mported in to the state.
2 This r emaine d true even 
when i ncluding inboun d air c argo and m ail (approximately 
400,000 tons in 2016).3 This i s shown i n Figure 2. 
Hawai‘i’s energy consumption of 293 trillion Btu in 2018 was 
slight ly lower t han it had been i n 2003. As shown i n Figure 3 , 
Hawaiʻi’s energy overall energy demand increased rapidly 
between 2003 and 2007,  dropped i n 2008, and increased 
gradually between 2008 and 2018.

United States ....:,._ As the only state still primarily reliant on oil-fired electrical generation, and with a significant demand for jet fuel, 
Hawai‘i depends more on petroleum for its energy needs than does any other state ,4 as shown in Figure 4. 
Figure 4 -Dependence of States on Petroleum for their Energy Needs, 2018 
Over the past several years, Hawai ‘i’s 
petroleum d ependence h as gradually 
been r educed,  from 9 0 percen t in 
2003 t o 84 percen t in 20 18. This can 
be seen in Figure 5.5 
Petroleum is still one of Hawai ‘i’s 
primary im ports.  Of total Hawaiʻi 
import s for 2 018, 60 percen t (by d ollar 
value ) wer e petroleum -related 
commodities ; the im port value o f 
these foreign a nd d omestic f uels i n 
2018 was $3.3 billion.6 
Since 2010, Hawai‘i has imported the 
maj
ority of its foreign crude oil from Indonesia, Russia , and Libya , as shown in Figure 7.  As shown in Figure 6, more than 
90 percent of foreign crude imports arrived from Libya and Russia in 20 19, with the remaining arriving from South Sudan 
and Argentina.7

heat for water, cooking, etc.), 
tracking energy flows can be 
complicated. 
As illustrated by the Sankey 
diagram11 in Figure 10, there are 
several important parts of an 
energy system: sources, uses , 
electricity generation , and the 
efficiency of converting energy to services such as lighting, heated water, and power to the 
wheels of a vehicle . Rejected 
energy is the energy, usually emitted as waste heat, that is not used directly for a needed service. 
Also shown are non-e lectricity energy flows, 
primarily petroleum to t ransportation.

Figure 13 - Hawai‘i’s Electric Utility Service Territories 
The two primary electric utilities serving Hawai‘i are 
Hawaiian Electric and Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative 
(KIUC). Hawaii an E lectric , an investor- owned utility , is 
the largest supplier of electricity in the state and 
provides electricity to the majority of Hawai‘i’s 
population . KIU C opera tes as a c ooperative. B oth ar e 
regulated b y the Hawai ‘i Public Ut ilities C ommission. 
The se rvice t erritorie s of the u tilities are s hown in 
Figur e 13. In D ecember, 20 19, Hawaiia n Electric 
announced that “ Hawaiia n Electric will ad opt a ‘d oing 
business a s’ model, with t he three in dividual c orporate 
entities re maining bu t all doing busines s as Hawaii an 
Electric ” beginning in Ja nuary, 2 020, wit h the 
“transitio n to th e Hawaii an E lectric n ame” t aking place 
over se vera l months. Th e three entiti es are Hawaiian E lectric C ompany, I nc. ( HECO), serving t he is land of O‘ahu; M aui 
Electric Company, Limited (MECO), serving the islands of Maui, Moloka‘i, and Lāna‘i (Maui County), and Hawai‘i 
Electric Light Company, Inc. (HELCO), serving the island of Hawai‘i. The combination is shown in Figure 13. 19 
Average Electricity R ates i n Hawai ‘i 
As shown in Figure 14, Hawaiʻi’s 
average electricity prices are more Figure 14 - Hawai‘i’s electricity prices are more than double the U.S. average 
than double the national average, 
and have fluctuated over the years in a manner similar to the fluctuations in the price of oil 
(shown previously, in Figure 9). 
This makes many of the energy 
efficiency measures and renewable 
energy technologies even more 
cost- effective in Hawaiʻi than they 
are in other U.S. locations.

Energy Efficiency 
The saying, “e nergy efficiency first,” 
reflects the understanding that it is 
generally cheaper and more resource -
efficient to avoid using a kilowatt -hour 
than it is to generate or purchase a 
kilowatt -hour. A study published in 2020 
collected information from forty -one states 
and found that the national sales -weighted 
average cost per kilowatt -hour saved was 
generally less than three cents per 
kilowatt -hour saved: $0.025 for all 
programs; $0.021 for residential; $0.025 
for commercial and industrial; and $0.105 for the highest- cost programs, which 
focused on assisting low income 
customers. This compares to the U.S. average retail price of electricity in the same period of about ten cents per kWh 
and,  in Hawai‘i , between twenty and thirty-f our cents.23 
This i s the b asis f or the rule o f thumb t hat each d ollar spent o n efficienc y (for cu rrent p rograms, in ag gregate ) save s ten 
times that a mount o n ener gy bills . As shown later (Tabl e 5), Hawai‘i  saving s for p rogram year 2019 w as fifteen to one.

  Energy Effi ciency P ortfolio S tandards (EEP S) 
Hawaiʻi has a State E nergy Efficiency Portfolio Standard, contained in section 269-96 o f the Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, to 
reduce electricity consumption in Hawaiʻi by 4, 300 gigawatt-ho urs by 2030. To fund the energy efficiency program, a 
Public Benefits Fee surcharge is collected via util ity customers’ electricity bills. The program is assigned to the Hawai ʻi 
Public Ut ilities C ommissio n (PUC ) for administration. Kauaʻi Island Ut ility C ooperativ e (KIUC ) runs th e energy ef ficiency 
program in its service territory (on the island of Kauaʻi ). In the service territories of the Hawaiian Electric Companies 
(the islands of Oʻahu , Maui, Molokaʻ i, Lānaʻi, and Hawaiʻi), the energy efficiency program is operated by Hawai ʻi Energy 
unde r contrac t to t he P UC. Every fi ve years, t he PUC r eports o n the p rogram s to the State Legislature.24 Findings i n the 
report t o the 2 019 L egislature included , 
“The EEPS goal has been effective at accelerating deployment of energy efficiency resources 
throughout the State. During the First EEPS Performance Period (2009-2 015), Hawaiʻi achieved an 
estimated 2,030 GWh of electricity savings, exceeding the 2015 goal of 1,375 GWh of energy savings by 
nearly 50%. An additional 530 GWh of savings was achieved in 2016-2 017…” 
“…Energy efficiency remains a lower cost resource than most other energy options, while providing 
many other important benefits to Hawaiʻi’s electric utilities and ratepayers. However, Hawaiʻi’s energy 
landscape has evolved significantly since the EEPS goal was established in 2009. Given the substantial 
increase in renewable energy available in Hawaiʻi (such as solar PV and wind), it is no longer a given that 
energy efficiency will always displace fossil fuel generation. As customers continue to invest in low-c ost 
renewable energy and increasingly, energy storage, energy efficiency programs and investments must be integrated with other clean energy initiatives...” and 
“… the incentives and services delivered by the Hawaiʻi Energy program … were delivered at a cost far 
below the avoided cost of electricity generation. These impacts are expected to generate over three 
billion dollars of utility bill savings for customers over the life of the installed efficiency measures.” 
The Public Benefits F ee Surcharge added to the electricity bil ls of Hawaii an Electric Company customers for the 
2020-2 021 Program Year, based on 2.0 percent of the forecasted revenues and reduced by the amount of the Green 
Infrastructure Fee, is 0.5882 cents per kWh for residential customers and 0.3441 cents per kWh for commercial and 
industrial customers. This i s a reduction from the previous levels of 0.7437 and 0.614 cents per kWh, respectively.25 The 
amounts collected are used to fund the activities of Hawaiʻi Energy, the Public Benefits Fee Administrator (PBFA) in the 
service territories of the Hawaii an Electric Company (i.e., the islands of Oʻahu , Maui, Moloka‘i, Lānaʻi, and Hawai ʻi). 
The Resource Cost Adjustment Surcharge Provision for KIUC is not applied to residential or streetlight service. For the 
other rate schedules, the fee i s 0.000881 cents per kWh.26 
Statewid e Market Poten tial Stu dy 
The results from the Hawai ʻi Statewide Market Potential Study, performed for the Public Utiliti es Commission and 
released in August of 2020, indicate that additional energy efficiency efforts are needed to meet the energy efficiency 
targets of 2030.  However, the future achievable, economic, and technical  potential  are roughly double the energy 
efficiency savings to date. Key findings are highlighted i n the figures and text below.27

ment Agencies’ Energy 
Efficiency Programs 
As shown in Figure 23, Hawai‘i 
state agencies’  electricity use in 
2019 was 17.5 percent less than i t 
was 2005 (the baseline year).  
HSEO tracks and reports on 
electricity purchased by state 
agencies as part of the “Lead By 
Example” (LBE) initiative.  
As shown in Figure 24, even with 
generally decreasing amounts of 
electricity use by State agencies 
from year to year (the orange 
line), electricity bills (the gray line) 
go 
up and down due to the 
varying price of electricity (the 
blue line), which is largely 
affected by the price of oil 
(the yellow line).   
Figur
e 23 - Comparison of State Agencies’ Electricity Consumption in kWh: 
F
Y05 to FY19 
Figure 24 – State Government A gency Electricity C ost Variability by Year (2005 baseline) 
Several  factors have contributed to the decline shown by the orange line: participation in energy efficiency programs; 
energy-e fficient design in construction and renovation; and energy performance contracts.  
Since 1996, state agencies have received nearly $13.1 million in efficiency rebates.29 Combined,  these rebates have 
resulted in more than $302 million estimated cumulative dollar savings and 1.6 billion kWh electricity savings. Over the 
life of the equipment, these savings would be enough to power about 192,000 households for a year.30 From June 2019 
through March 2020, state agencies received $420,000 in rebates. 
The state also requires all new constructi on and major renovation to meet “Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design” (LEED) S ilver standards, to the extent possible.31

Saving Energy Through Building Design 
Buildings use a great deal of energy, and potential energy savings are significant. According to the U.S. Department of 
Energy :33 
“The buildings sector accounts for about 76% of electricity use and 40% of all U.S. primary energy use 
and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions… Opportunities for improved efficiency are enormous. 
By 2030 building energy use could be cut more than 20% using technologies known to be cost effective 
today and by more than 35% if research goals are met. Much higher savings are technically possible. ” 
Building Codes ; State Energy Building Code Council; County Energy Codes 
In a study published in 2020 that collected information from forty -one states , efforts to improve e nergy -efficient 
building codes and standards were recognized as a very low -cost measure (far left ), at significantly less than one cent 
per kWh saved , as shown in Figure 26.34

  International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 
With the adoption of the 2015 IECC (as amended) b y the City and County of Honolulu in June 2020, all of Hawai ʻi’s 
counties have now adopted the 2015 IECC with Hawai‘i amendments.35 The estimated net savings from the 2015 
IECC with Hawai ‘i amendments i s 12,962 MWh in 2019; 1,083,590 MWh in 2029 (year 10); 1,991,059 MWh in 2032; 
and 4 ,702,738 MWh i n 2038 (year 20). Savings are greater in commercial buildings, that are expected to save about 
33 percent compared to the 2006 IECC. The savings estimates will rise as a result of additional amendments adopted 
by the counties.36 
Residential Code S avings: Fully conditioned 2015 IECC residences may achieve a 6 to 9 percent i mprovement in energy 
efficiency. T hose f ollowing the T ropical Climate Z one c ompliance pat h could r ealiz e a savings o f up t o 48 percent 
compared t o the model code by opting to u tilize n atural ventilation a nd c hoosing the highest -efficiency o ptions when

Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 
According to State Market Briefs released by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), as of October 2020, Hawai‘i 
had 1 32 LEED certified projects with a gross square footage of over 9.3 million square feet. The certified buildings 
included numerous private developments, as well  as federal,  state, and county public buildings. Also, there are 948 
LEED Credentialed professionals, plus 236 with LEED Specialties, and an additional 107 LEED Green Associates, based 
in Hawai‘i. 38 In 2019, Hawai‘i was back among the top 10 states for LEED certified project square footage per capita. 
With 4.08 million LEED-c ertified gross square footage and 12 projects certified, Hawai‘i rated 5th highest state i n the 
U.S. this year.39 
ENERGY S TAR® Bui ldings 
Since 2 000, 174 H awai‘i buildings c overing o ver 3 2 million s quare f eet have received t he ENERGY STAR c ertification, 
including over 100 public buildings. 40 During thi s time, HSEO has helped to benchmark 416 state facilities (w ith over

ApplianceEff iciencyStandards 
Federal efficiency s tandards are in plac e for a variety o f consume r products. 41,42 According to t he U .S. Department o f 
Energy ( DOE),43 
“Appliance and equipment efficiency standards have served as one of the nation’s most effective policies 
to improve energy efficiency and to save consumers energy and money …  DOE is currently required to 
periodically review standards and test procedures for more than 60 products, representing about 90% of 
home energy use, 60% of commercial building energy use, and 30% of industrial energy use …” 
Also, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency,44 
“State appliance standards establish minimum energy -efficiency levels for appliances and other energy -
consuming products ... States are finding that appliance standards offer a cost -effecti ve strategy for 
improving energy efficiency and lowering energy costs for businesses and consumer s… some of the 
products with the largest potential for savings in each sector [are being] considered by an Appliance 
Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) …” 
According to the 2020 report by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, the national appliance standards that 
are in place are saving Hawaiʻi households about $945 a year on utility bills, and businesses $158 million per year.45 
The 2020 “States Go First” report estimated potential cumulative future (by 2035) savings in Hawaiʻi of 44 GWh of 
electricity, 3 billion gallons of water and 455 metric tons of CO 2 if Hawaiʻi were to adopt the 2020 State Appliance 
Standards Recommendations.46

Hawaii Green Business Program 
To help businesses implement energy and resource efficiency practices, the Hawaii Green Business Program was 
established as a partnership between the HSEO, the Department of Health,  the Board of Water S upply, and the Chamber 
of Commerce of Hawai‘i .47 From 2009 through 2018, over 125 business and government entiti es—including sectors 
such as hospitality, commercial office, retail, restaurant, food services,  grocery, venue and green events have saved: 48 
•23.5 million kWh of energy (equivalent to powering 3,620 homes for one year in Hawai‘i);
•244.1 million gallons of water; and
•$6.6 million in energy costs .
Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority 
The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authorit y (“HGIA”) was created by the Legislature to make clean energy i nvestments 
accessible and affordable for Hawai‘i’ s consumers. HGIA was capitalized with the proceeds from the Green Energy 
Market Securitization (“GEMS”) Bond, an i nnovative market-driven financing mechanism, to advance Hawai‘i’s Energy 
Efficiency Portfol io Standards (“EEPS”) and to support efforts to the 100 percent renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) 
goal in the electricity sector by 2045. The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority is Hawai‘ i’s Green Bank. 
Shown in Tabl e 7 are HGIA Program result s utilizing some $67.5 million in l oan capital to leverage $37.3 million in 
private capital, for a total $104.8 million i n clean energy investments wi thin the Hawaiian Electric ’s service territory.

Distributed Energy Resources 
The term “Distributed Energy Resources” (DER) has been evolving over the years. Currently, in the Hawai‘i 
Public Util ities Commission Docket No. 2019-0 323, the term is broadly defined: 
“DER” includes “distributed generation, energy efficiency, demand 
response, electric vehicles, and distributed energy storage.” 
The definition provided above is broader than that which had been common previously, which generally referred to 
on-site generation of electricity from renewable resources; electricity generation from fossil fuels, such as backup 
generators running on diesel or propane; combined heat and power (or heat, power, and cooling systems) generating 
both el ectricity and heat for use on site; and battery storage. 
The vast majority of “customer sited DER” systems in Hawai‘i are photovoltaic (PV) installations that are connected to 
the electrical grid. DER installations have been increasing, as shown in Figure 28, and are currently the largest collective source of renewable energy generation in Hawai‘i.

hours (GWh) and Percent by Source, 2019 
In 2019, over 2 ,000 gigawatt -hours (2,741 GWh) of 
renewable electricity was generated from a variety of 
sources, as shown in Figure 27.52 Sources were: 
•Distributed photovoltaics (PV) at 1,280 GWh ,

Th
e amount contributed by the various sources to the 
renewable energy total has changed over the years, as 
shown in Figure 28 (comparative amounts) and Figure 32 (stacked amounts) . 
Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) 
Much of the increase in renewable generation in Hawai‘i may be attributed to Hawai‘i’s renewable portfolio standard 
(RPS) law, which defi nes “renewable energy”  as electricity generated or produced using the following sources:53 
•Biofuels
•Biogas
•Biomass,
 including solid waste
•Falli
ng water (hydropower)
•Geothermal
•Hydrogen
 produced from renewable energy s ources
•Ocean water, currents, and waves, i
ncluding ocean thermal energy conversion
•Sun
•Wind

The definition of “Renewable Portfolio S tandard” is “the percentage of el ectrical energy sal es that is represented by 
renewable electrical energy.”55 It includes, in the numerator, the gigawatt-h ours generated by rooftop solar systems 
and utility-scale renewable energy. The denominator is the gigawatt-hours of electricity sold by the utility, which does 
not i nclude electricity produced by rooftop systems and used on-s ite (also referred to as “behind the meter”).  
Hawaiian Electric 
As shown in Figure 30, top left, Hawaii an Electric has exceeded the required RPS  levels to date. The contributions of 
the individual entities are also shown. The Hawaii an Electric companies provide quarterly data on their RPS 
performance and a variety of other metrics (including “System Renewable Energy,” which does not i nclude customer-
sited renewable generation, and “Total Renewable Energy,” which adds customer-sited generation to the denominator) 
on their website.56 Data from the RPS reports filed with the PUC is provided in Table 8.57

800,000 therms of biogas annually, for distribution and use on O‘ahu. 
Biomass Energy Projects and Production 
Biomass includes biomass c rops g rown p rimarily o r secondarily f or energy conversion ( energy crops), ag ricultural and 
animal residues and w astes, m unicipal solid w aste , and o ther so lid waste ( waste -to-energy). 
The G reen E nergy B iomass -to-Energy fac ility on K aua‘i is t he firs t “closed l oop” biomass p lant in the United S tates that 
gets all its fe edstock f rom i ts own local wood plantations. The fac ility als o reuses it s own water, c arbon d ioxide, and ash

  Geothermal 
The Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) facility owned and operated by Ormat Technologies and located in Pāhoa on the 
east side of Hawai‘i Island, with a capacity of 38 MW, was closed in May 2018 due to the Kīlauea eruption and remains closed as of October 2020.
61 In its last full year of operation (2 017), PGV generated nearly 31 p ercent o f the electricity 
distributed by the electric utility on Hawai‘i  Island. 
Hydropower 
Hydropower Projects and Production 
Several  small  home-s cale plants, commercial and municipal installations, and utility-s cale hydropower facilities are 
currently in operation in Hawai‘i, totaling around 30 megawatts (MW) of installed hydroelectricity capacity statewide. 
Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i  Island are the only islands on which utility-s cale hydropower projects are operating.  
Hawai‘i’s largest hydropower plant is the 12.1 MW Wailuku River plant on Hawai‘i Island, and the smallest is the 6.7 kW 
Ainako Hydro project developed and used by a community group on Hawai‘i Island. Also, the Hawai‘i County 
Department of Water Supply (DWS) has three small  in-line hydropower plants under 100 kilowatts that capture the 
energy from pipes carrying water to DWS customers in West Hawai‘i.  
In 2019,  hydropower represented 11.2 percent of the total electricity sold by KIUC on Kaua‘i and 3.4 percent of the 
electricity sold by Hawaii an Electric on Hawai‘i  island, the only two islands that generated reported hydroelectricity 
that year.  In 2019,  hydropower represented 0.94 percent of the total energy distributed by Hawai‘i’s electric utilities 
statewide. 
Hydropower Pricing 
In Fiscal  Year 2019, the amounts paid for electricity from Hawai‘i’s hydropower facilities were: 62 
Kaua‘i C offee H ydro $0.20/kWh 
Gay & Robinson Olokele $0.178/kWh 
Kekaha Agricultural Association Hydro $0.0917/kWh 
Wailuku River Hydro $0.1598/kWh (on -peak), $0.1536/kWh (off -peak) 
Ocean Energy 
Ocea n or marin e energy i ncludes b oth h ydrokinetic a nd th ermal  resources. H ydrokinetic t echnologi es tap t he movement 
of wate r in the ocean —waves, c urrents a nd tides—to generat e electricity . Ocean T hermal  Energy C onversion ( OTEC) 
makes use of the temperature differences between warm surface waters and cold,  deep ocean waters. Research on 
OTEC is ongoing at the Natural  Energy Laboratory of Hawai i Authority (NELHA) on Hawai ‘i Island, and demonstrations of 
wave energy technologi es are taking place at the Wave Energy Test Site on O‘ahu.  Cold, deep ocean water can also be 
used for sea water air conditioning (SWAC), which is being done on Hawai‘i  Island at NELHA and is under development 
for Downtown Honolulu. 
Ocean c urrent an d tidal re sources are n ot as promising in Haw ai‘i due to re lativel y mild t idal shifts c ompared t o other 
parts o f the world. 
Hawai‘ i’s electric u tilities d o not c urrently report an y electricity g eneration f rom wave o r OTE C facilities. 
Solar Energy 
Energy from the sun is used directly for water heating (please see the section on Energy Efficiency) as well as for 
electricity production on-s ite (please see the section on Distributed Energy Resources) and from utility-s cale 
installations (information provided below).

Hawai‘i’s transformation to a clean energy economy requires the integration of transportation. In tackling 
transportation HSEO has a ne ar-term focus in ground transportation and maintains a long- term perspective that 
includes alternative fuels and efficiency in aviation and marine transportation. 
As shown in Figure 34, the transportation sector is a major user of energy in Hawaiʻi. The transportation sector 
consum ed about 55 percent of the primary energy used i n Hawaiʻi in 2018.65 
Figure 34 - Total Energy Consumption in Hawai‘i by Sector, Trillion Btu per Year, 1960-2018 
Figure 35 - Transportation Fuel Use in Hawai‘i, Trillion Btu per Year 
Within th e transportation s ector, 
major fuel types, shown i n Figure 35, 
were the following of the 
transportation fuel total in 2018.66 
•Jet fuel at 54% ;
•Gasoline (including ethanol) at
33% ; 
•Diesel (including biodiesel) at
9%; and 
•Bunker fuel, at 4%
Hawai‘i’s Clean Transportation Laws and Proclamations 
Hawai‘i’s clean transportation policies are now at the forefront of the legislative agenda in Hawai‘i. 
•HRS §226-1 8(a)(2) – Hawai‘i State Planning Act; Objectives and policies for facility systems – e nergy.  
Increased energy security and self-s ufficiency through the reduction and ultimate elimination of Hawai‘i’s  
dependence on i mported fuels for electrical  generation and ground transportation;
•HRS §103D-4 12 – Hawai‘i’s vehicle procurement guidelines require st ate and co unty agencies to follow a

RS §225P -3 – Hawai‘i climate change mitigation and adaptation commission; general functions, duties, and
powers aligning Hawai‘i with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
•City and County of Honolulu, Maui County, Hawai‘i County, and Kaua‘i County committed to eliminate fossil
fuels use within ground transportation by 2045 – mirroring the 100 percent RPS time frame for the electric
sector. Notably the City and County of Honolulu, Maui County , Hawai‘i County, and Kaua‘i County pledged to
lead the way by transitioning all of their fleet vehicles to 100 percent clean energy by 2035.
Ground Transportation Sector 
Ground transportation energy demand i s driven by the quantity of transportation ( passenger-m iles and ton-m iles) 
needed; the modes (e.g., car, truck,  bus, bicycle) used to meet the transportation needs; the fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, 
biodiesel,  hydrogen , electricity, h uman po wer) needed t o prope l the various m odes; a nd the prim ary energy s ources 
(e.g., petroleum, solar, cooking oil, other materials) used to create the fuels. 
To reduce Hawai ‘i’s consumption of petroleum within the ground transportation sector,  the HSEO i s looking to 
implement tactics that will  make a transformational investment in Hawai ‘i’s clean energy economy. As the designated 
agency t o administer th e Volkswagen S ettlement Environmental Trus t on behalf of the State H SEO d eveloped a 
Beneficiary Mitigation Plan th at focuse d on market ready z ero e mission t echnologies. To th at en d there i s a specific 
emphasi s on p rojects t hat f acilitate t he a doption an d deployment o f electric drive v ehicle s and c harging in frastructure. 
This f ocus c omplemen ts the commitmen ts of th e counties t o conver t their f leets to 100 percen t renewable e nerg y by 
2035 and builds on the momentum created from the counties’ adoption of battery electric transit buses. 
As Hawai‘i moves forward i n the effort to decarbonize the economy a broad view of decarbonization strategies will  
need to be taken. As with electricity consumption,  a focus on greater efficiency on mobility services is a fundamental 
requirement for Hawai‘i to achieve its goals. HSEO’s 2015 Hawai ‘i Clean Energy Initiative Transportation Energy 
Analysis67 identifie d mobility e fficiencies as having t he largest p otential  to reduce f ossil fuel c onsumption , 29 – 34 MGY,

must be addressed from the community level to state government in order to come up wi th a solution that meets the 
needs
 of all  of Hawai ‘i. As with el ectricity, efficiency i n ground transportation must be a key strategy for Hawai‘i. 
P

advancement of transportation decarbonization strategies and policies. As the HSEO continues to expand its assessment 
of clean transportation in Hawai‘i  HSEO will be incorporating additional  clean transportation facts and figures.

Bicycling 
Bicycling reduces transportation emissions while also reducing traffic, in addition to be ing a low -impact form of exercise. 
Alternative forms of transportation such as bicycling are a means by which to decarbonize the transportation sector by 
reducing demand for vehicle fuels .

“Alternative fuels” (and “alternate fuel,” used interchangeably) are defined in State73 and Federal law74 to include: 
•Alcohol (methanol, ethanol, and others) and mixtures of alcohol and gasoline with at least of 85% alcohol ;
•N
atural gas ;
•L
iquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also known as Propane ;

•E
lectricity (including electricity from solar energy) .
The
 State’s alternative fuels standard goal, Section 196-4 2 of the Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes, sets forth an objective of 
20 percent of Hawai‘i’s ground transportation needs to be met by non-petroleum sources by 2020:75 
State support for achieving alternate fuels standards. The State shall 
facilitate the development of alternate fuels and support the attainment 
of a statewide alternate fuels standard of ten per cent of highway fuel demand to be provided by alternate fuels by 2010, fifteen per cent by 2015, twenty per cent by 2020, and thirty per cent by 2030. 
Several  alternative fuels are in use in Hawai‘i , including ethanol blended in gasoline at a rate of 10 percent in most areas; 
biodiesel, p roduced l ocall y by P acific Bi odiesel; h ydrogen, av ailabl e on O‘ah u to o wners o f Toyota M irai vehicl es; a nd

An electric vehicle (EV) uses electricity in place of petroleum-b ased (gasoline or diesel) fuel. As EVs can use electricity 
produced from renewable resources available i n Hawai‘i (i.e., sun, wind, hydropower, biomass, ocean energy, 
geothermal energy), the transition from gasoline- and diesel -fueled vehicles to EVs supports Hawai ‘i’s energy 
independence g oals. 
As shown i n Tab le 15 , ther e are over 12,000 el ectric v ehicl es register ed in Hawai‘i as o f October 2 020. Th is number 
continues t he steady in creas e in e lectric v ehicle r egistration s illustrated b y Figur e 38. There are also 2 86 p ublic e lectric 
vehicle c harging stations , as s hown i n Table 16 .

Fuel cost comparisons show approximate savings between energy efficient internal combustion engine and electric 
vehicles. The example presented i n Table 17 illustrates that fuel costs for an electric vehicle can be materially less than 
for a fuel efficient gasoline fueled vehicle.

Ethanol fuel is primarily used in the transportation sector. 
Hawai‘i does not have any in- state ethanol production. 
Biodiesel fuel is used both for transportation and in electricity 
production. Biodiesel fuel is produced in Hawai‘i; quantities 
are shown in Figure 40.81 
Hydrogen 
Hydrogen has several uses and applications. It is used as a 
transportation fuel, as mentioned in the previous section.  It 
can also be produced from renewable sources, stored, and 
then used in vehicles or to produce electricity.  Finally, it can be blended and distributed through pipelines for use in homes and businesses as a component of utility gas.

Renewable natural gas production in Hawai‘ i, shown in Table 19, has increased .  
As described in the 2019 Renewable Energy Repor t,88 
“Hawai‘i Gas produces SNG [synthetic natural gas] using mainly 
a blend of liquid naphtha, steam, water and hydrogen gas … 
non-p etroleum feedstocks include not only the hydrogen made 
from recycled water at the Honouliuli WWTP [wastewater 
treatment plant], and RNG from the Honouliuli WWTP Biogas 
Project, but also the water and a portion of the carbon 
monoxide used to produce S NG at the SNG Plant. Under a 
revised methodology looking at total non-p etroleum 
feedstocks, in 2019, total non-p etroleum feedstocks 
accounted for 11.4 percent of the total feedstock used to 
produce SNG and RNG, based on a thermal ratio.” 
Both hydrogen and methane are produced from renewable and non -petroleum 
feedstocks and are included in the product distributed by Hawai‘i Gas.

observed locally 
(increased energy 
efficiency, and use of renewable energy ) 
are also bein g 
observed n ationally 
and internationally .
97 As 
shown in Figure 48, 
in the graph on the left, hydropower has 
in recent years been 
joined by energy 
production from a 
combination of 
wind, solar, wood, and geothermal resources in the production of electricit y in the U.S. Likewise, in non -electricity 
energy areas, energy production from wood and waste continues, with increasing contributions from biofuels, solar, and 
geothermal resources for fuels and heat . 
Finally, t he 2020 Global Energy Review included a historical loo k back at rates of change in energy demand over the 
years , with major global events superimposed on the grap h, shown in Figure 49.98

 Message from the Chief Energy Oﬃcer  
 
I am honored and privileged to assume the role of Chief 
Energy Officer, upon my appointment by Gov. Josh Green to a 
four-year term.  The Hawai‘ i Energy Office (HSEO) holds a 
special place in my heart, having served as Energy 
Administrator from 2011 -16 during the formative years of the 
Hawai‘i Clean Energy Initiative . Since I last served, Legislature  
has expanded HSEO’s  statutory mandate to encompass energy 
security, resilience, jobs, affordability,  and the growing urgency 
of the climate crisis. As always,  I am inspired and  impressed 
by the remarkable skills, expertise, and knowledge of HSEO’s  
dedicated staff and managers.   
As the pioneer state in establishing a 100 percent renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for electricity, Hawai‘ i has set the stage as a leader in the energy transition. 
Today, several states and territories have followed our lead, underscoring the importance of our commitment. These things are easier said than done, and my 
office  recognize s that our journey toward energy self -sufficiency and 
decarbonization will present challenges, twists, and turns. Embracing these 
challenges is integral to our mission.   
On Augst 8
th, 2023, we were confronted by the devastating fires on Maui. In the 
immediate response to the fires, HSEO actively supported the State’s Emergency Operations Center under the leadership of Hawai‘i  Emergency Management  Agency 
(HIEMA), contributing to critical energy infrastructure needs and providing vital information to first responders and the public. As we transition into long- term 
recovery, our commitment to disaster response and climate resilience remains unwaverin g.   
Since the tragedy on August 8
th, Hawai‘ i has secured over $110 million for grid 
resilience, with three successful applications selected by the U.S. Department of 
Energy (USDOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program created by 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). HSEO led two of these 
applications, in cooperation with Kaua‘i  Island Utility Cooperative  (KIUC) , and 
Hawaii an Electric (HECO) led the third with HSEO playing a supporting role. This 
cooperation  and support at the highest levels of the Biden Administration and 
USDOE  as well as among our private sector and nongovernmental partners  is about 
much more than HSEO winning  competitive grants, it is the collaborative spirit that 
will make  our state climate resilient and energy self -sufficient .   
HSEO also aims to ensure access to the benefits of the clean energy transition for everyone. This includes providing training for quality local jobs in clean energy. This 
year, HSEO worked with the Hawai‘i  Chamber of Commerce and University of 
5 Hawai‘i Community Colleges, among others, to launch Good Jobs Hawai‘i and the 
Clean Energy Sector Partnership. This three-y ear effort will train or up-skills 
hundreds of Hawai‘i residents to make the transition a reality , and we remain 
committed to developing other policies and programs that support the creation of 
quality local jobs.   
Looking ahead, next year HSEO will begin a home energy efficiency retrofit and 
electrification r ebate program funded by the Inflation R eduction Ac t (IRA). I n 
coordination with partners lik e the Hawai‘i Green Infrastructure Authorit y, we a im to 
make it easier for households to sav e energy and save on their energy bills. While 
our valiant bid to become a Hydrogen H ub was unsuccessful, we gained much f rom 
the experienc e to prepar e a competitiv e $1 billion application with m ore than 4 3 
committed partners. From lessons l earned, w e are evaluating alternativ e options for 
energy supplies, including geothermal, that can insulat e families and small 
businesses from oil price volatilit y, provide reliable power, and significantly reduce 
our environmental impact.    
Through t he IIJA and IRA, Congress and the Biden Administration have made 
unprecedented, historic in vestments in climate resilient infrastructure. D eputy U .S. 
Energy Secretary David Turk called it a “magic moment” in h is keynote at the 
Hawai‘ i Energy Policy Forum in January 2023. Recognizing this, HSEO will continue 
to capitalize on these opportunities t o ensure the clean energy transition, and work 
with pa rtners across the state to improv e our climate resilience and affordabilit y. I 
look forward to collabo rating w ith all stakeholders, both in the p ublic and pr ivate 
sectors, as we navigate the challenges and emerge stronger in the fac e of emerging 
threats.  
With Aloha,

 Executive Summary 
Overview  
Since Hawai‘i became the first state in the nation to set a 100 percent renewable 
portfolio standard (RPS) for the electricity sector by 2045 with  Act 97 Session Laws 
of Hawai‘ i 2015, Hawai‘ i has made substantial progress moving toward a cleaner 
energy sector.  This report reviews the work of Hawai‘ i State Energy Office (HSEO) 
over the past year in effort to lead the state’s energy transition.    
Governor Josh Green, M.D., appointed HSEO veteran Mark B. Glick as the state’s 
Chief Energy Officer  (CEO) , who was confirmed by the Senate on April 3, 2023. This 
is Glick’s second stint in the Energy Office, having served previously as Energy 
Administrator leading the development of Hawai‘ i’s Clean Energy Initiative, the 
precursor to today’s carbon -free pathway. Glick named Stephen C. Walls as Deputy 
Energy Officer, who worked on the Hawai’i Clean Energy Initiative while at the U.S. 
Department of Energy (USDOE)  where he also co- established the national Energy 
Transition Initiative .   
In working with the Green Administration to establish the Hawai‘i State Energy Office’s energy strategy,  the CEO aligned the agency’s workstreams with the 
elements of a successful e nergy transition: Renewable generation; grid 
modernization ; energy storage; clean transportation; energy efficiency; and 
governance and equit y. A new branch w as formed that  focused on achieving an 
equitable energy system through access to quality local jobs and community engagement. The new Jobs and Outreach branch (JOBs) joins the Energy Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy branch (EERE), the Re silience , Clean Transportation, and 
Analytics branch (RCA), and the Operations branch (OPs), along with the CEO’s 
Executive Office  team. The Office reorganization incorporates Act 122 and the 
flexibility of exempt positions.    
Energy Eﬃciency and Renewable Energy Branch  
Energy efficiency and conservation —using more efficient technologies, energy -
conserving systems, and beneficial policies —reduces the amount of energy that 
needs to be produced.  Energy efficiency and conservation are “energy resources” 
in their own way.  E fficiency is often the lowest cost of any available resource, 
costing less to save a kilowatt -hour than it would cost to generate that kilowatt -
hour and making it a  least-cost method of  balanc ing energy demand with  adequate 
energy supplies . 
One of the most effect ive long -term energy efficiency measures is the use of  
updated energy codes and standards  when constructing new buildings .  Energy 
codes  are updated nationally every three years, based on improved methods and 
materials , reviewed,  and approved by the State Building Code Council, and enacted 
by each of the counties . HSEO  conduct s energy code training for design , 7 
 engineering,  and code professionals, provides testimony  in support of county code 
adoption , and supports improved efficiency standards for  appliances . 
Buildings  owned and operated by the State of Hawai‘i  are also significant users of 
energy; HSEO assists agencies to identify cost -effective  energy - and resource-  
efficient  upgrades , including the use of rebates, financing mechanisms , and el ective 
pay options . 
HSEO is also preparing for a major  increase in energy efficiency incentives for  
commercial  and residential buildings , and for the launch of rebate programs  to 
assist primarily low - and moderate- income residents . 
Businesses are also actively reducing the energy and resource intensity of their 
operations.  This year, the Hawai‘i  Green Business Program recognized its largest 
ever annual cohort  and expanded to include more small businesses in rural areas  
across  the state , and a  total of 37 businesses, venues, and events received awards 
for undertaking efficiency and sustainable business practices that will help their 
bottom line while advancing Hawai‘i’s clean energy and sustainability goals.  
Hawai‘i shift from carbon -intensive imported fossil fuels features locally available 
energy sources: power from the sun, the wind, the ocean, and the land. As new 
energy generation is built, it becomes clear that supplying our energy demand 
requires land, resources, time, and effort. HSEO provides technical assistance and 
other support to communities and developers alike in the quest for energy self -
sufficiency.  
The construction of new renewable en ergy pr ojects, both large and small, continued  
at a rapid pa ce this year , with additional completions  scheduled for the coming year .  
Solutions were found to logistical challenges for previously approved projects , and 
HSEO engaged with regulators, communities, individuals,  and organizations to 
envision and propose new projects  and approaches , with the potential for significant 
savings and incentives from recent Federal legislation  to support Hawai‘i- based 
projects . In 202 3 Hawaii’s statewide renewable electricity portfolio reached 40.7% 
under the old calculation method (33.17% using the new calculation method ). 
Jobs and Outreach Branch  
This year, HSEO supported the launch of Good Jobs Hawai‘i  and led the launch of 
the Clean Energy Sector Partnership, working with the Hawai‘i i Chamber of 
Commerce and University of Hawai‘i  Community Colleges, among others. This 
three- year effort will train or up -skill hundreds of Hawai‘i  residents  in the clean 
energy  and skilled trades sectors , while remain ing committed to other policies and 
programs that support the creation of quality local jobs.   Complimenting these 
initiatives  is HSEO’s keiki -to-career pathways work  through the development of K -
12 energy curriculum, teacher training, Energy Pathway pilot  at select high schools, 
and service on  the Hawai‘i  Department of Education ’s Career and Technical 
Education Advisory Board.   8 
 HSEO continues to grow its innovative Clean Energy Wayf inders outreach program  
with the placement of six (6) new Wayfinders on Kaua‘i , O‘ahu (2), Moloka‘i, Maui, 
and Hawai‘i  Island. In 2023, HSEO initiated new professional  training for the 
Wayfinders through Hawai‘i  Sea Grant and will secure in early 2024 $1M in federal 
funds to expand the program’s capacity  to provide community -based  technical 
assistance  on priority clean energy initiatives .   
Resilience , Clean Transportation, and Analytics Branch  
Resilience  
Under the umbrella of Resilience HSEO prioritizes  the reliable delivery of fuel and 
electrical energy to support economic recovery and meet the demands of a 
growing, clean economy. A baseline capacity supporting this role is a "common 
operating picture" (COP)—  a continuously updated overview of Hawai‘i's energy 
system for energy planning and incident response. For planning HSEO completed a 
$600,000 grant under FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to assess the 
energy supply chain on O‘ahu  and the interdependencies of Community Lifelines — 
FEMA -defined customers that provide essential services in response to and recovery 
from all -hazards events —such as first responders, hospitals, water, and wastewater. 
Notably, while not surprising, the data and analysis supported the conclusion that fire is one of the top two risks. HSEO will receive $450,000 through FEMA BRIC 
funding to do the same assessment for each count y to complete a statewide 
picture .  
In addition, HSEO deploys capital to support investment in energy assurance and 
grid modernization. HSEO, in collaboration with  the Hawaiian Electric Company , was 
selected for a $8.33 million  FEMA BRIC National Competition for Critical Customer 
Hubs (CCH). CCHs are microgrids in areas with several Community Lifeline 
customers powered by mobile generation, allowing continued  operati on during a 
longer -duration outage. The CCH project was the first National Competition award 
for Hawai‘i . HSEO also  administers  over $15 million in IIJA Section 40101(d) 
funding for grid resilience. HSEO will use t he planning done under both Advance 
Assistance projects noted above to evaluate and select  project s.  
For grid modernization  HSEO, in partnership with KIUC, will receive more than 
$17.9 million in funding through the U.S. Department of Energy Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program.  Leveraging  existing power generation 
equipment , the Utility Solar Grid Forming Technology (USGFT) and Synchronous 
Condenser Conversion Technology (SCCT) demonstration projects  offer innovative 
grid forming technologies demonstrating solution s for expanded renewables 
dispatch and reliable island grid operation.  Together, these solutions are critical 
technologies to  enable KIUC to achieve its 100% renewable energy goal within the 
next ten years.  
Clean Transportation  9 
 Under Clean Transportation two areas of focus for HSEO has been supporting the 
continued adoption and deployment of infrastructure for zero emission vehicles 
(ZEV) and planning and programs to reduce the energy necessary to support the 
transportation services required by the residents of Hawai‘i.    
To support EV adoption and charging infrastructure deployment HSEO has sought to leverage  the investments that are being made throughout the state to meet  2030 
and 2045  requirements . This is  consistent with the addition to HRS, Chapter 
225P through Act 226 of 2023 to work with H DOT and OPSD to develop plans to 
ensure that the State's  electric charging capacity is  sufficient,  and State's electric 
charging capacity exceeds  the rate by which electric vehicle sales  are projected to 
replace internal  combustion vehicle sales.  HSEO has worked with H DOT on Hawai‘i ’s 
National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI)  plan and applications under 
federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI)  program. For CFI HSEO has 
leveraged Volkswagen Settlement (VW) funds as the 20% cost match to pursue an 
additional $3M of funding. HSEO has also partnered with Hawai‘i Department of 
Health – Clean Air Branch for a medium - and heavy -duty vehicle rebate program 
leveraging VW funds  to receive an incentive match of  fifty cents on the dollar  for 
the VW funds allocated to the rebate from the U.S. EPA . 
Energy efficiency and conservation  are also key tactic s for the transportation sector 
to adequately power and decarbonize.  For example, HSEO was awarded funding by 
the O‘ahu Metropolitan Planning Organization  (OMPO)  to conduct a multi -modal 
assessment to identify specific land -use and transportation needs and projects to 
reduce vehicle miles traveled and prepare them for inclusion in the Transportation 
Improvement Program. The project also include s the development of quantifiable 
metrics to improve multi -modal accessibility for people walking, rolling, biking, and 
using transit. Engaging with DOT and the metropolitan planning organization s on 
planning activities  to better reflect  the interdependencies of energy and 
transportation planning is a priority for HSEO. HSEO will continue to work with 
OMPO over the next year to support their O‘ahu Regional Transportation Plan  
(ORTP)  integrating  the scenarios  developed in the ORTP into HSEO’s Engage model  
that was utilized for the Act 238 Decarbonization Study. The intent is to be able to 
analyze the impacts of transportation on energy  use and deployment and visualize 
alternative  scenarios.  
Analytics  
Analytics serves as a foundation for informed decision -making  on all aspects of 
Hawai‘i’s energy transition . Under §196 -72 the duties of HSEO include acting as the 
State's energy data clearinghouse by identifying, collecting, compiling, analyzing, 
and publishing, energy and clean transportation data and analyses . Quality data  is 
necessary for  HSEO to develop and maintain a quantitative capacity to analyze the 
effectiveness of energy resources, systems, and markets for policy , regulatory 
decisions, and energy emergency planning.  10 
 HSEO, in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and 
supported by USDOE funding, has developed Engage , an open access, web 
application for energy system modeling. Similar models utilized in utility integrated 
grid planning proceedings cost tens of thousands of dollars in licensing fees per 
year. Engage provides a valuable tool by which HSEO can analyze policies and 
pathways to achieve state energy goals and was  utilized to develop HSEO’s Act 238 
Decarbonization Strategy. With base models and scenarios now set up for all islands  
HSEO has built the capacity to continue analyzing alternative scenarios to assess 
new policies and evolving technologies. HSEO is also integrating Engage with 
visualization tools such as the Hawai‘i Advanced Visualization Energy Nexus 
(HAVEN)  making energy system modeling analysis more readily digestible to 
individuals who have a significant stake in the transformation of Hawai‘i’s energy 
system but who are not energy sector specialists .     
HSEO has also developed a Data Portal to serve as  the foundation for a single 
source repository of energy related data for modeling and analysis inputs to support 
the State’s energy goals. The data portal is a transparent source of data including both source data and curated data sets which integrate multiple data sources. The 
Data Portal includes meta -data to support transparency as to what the data 
specifically represents  and how it was generated to provide confidence in the 
modeling outputs and the representation of outcomes.  
Operations Branch  
The team is responsible for actively seeking, tracking , and ensuring compliance with  
federal funding opportunities for grants that align with HSEO goals and priorities. In 
2023, the team processed applications for competitive and formula federal funds 
that secured more than $100 million for new programs to be implemented in 
Hawai‘i over the next several years.

 Energy Eﬃciency 
Introduction 
Energy efficiency is foundational to Hawai‘i’s renewable energy transition. As  
Hawai‘i develop s new energy generation sources that match the needs of each 
community , with land and energy at a premium, Hawai‘i is well  served by improving 
the effective use of these precious energy  resources . Energy efficiency works to 
improve the balance between energy use and availability. Re ducing energy waste 
allows  the renewable energy that is  brought online to serve a higher proportion  of 
Hawai‘i’s  energy needs .  
HSEO prioritizes the most cost-effective  and impactful energy efficiency programs. 
Improved  energy  codes and efficiency standards are recognized as cost -effective 
measures that establish  the minimum energy performance for commercial and 
residential buildings in Hawai‘i.  HSEO are engaged in development, evaluation, 
revision, and adoption of energy -related codes and standards that advance the 
State's energy goals  and yield cost savings for agencies, businesses, and re sidents.  
Hawai‘i is keeping pace with its goal of reducing electricity demand by 4,300  
gigawatt -hours by 2030 through efficiency and conservation measures with 
significant savings from lighting, cooling, water heating , and other  measures.  
HSEO collaborates with and provides information and technical review to 
government agencies, professional associations, and educational institutions in 
Hawai‘i to reduce energy use and to participate in performance contracting or other 
methods to finance energy improvements.  
Codes and standards  
The first step in energy efficiency for any new building is to design and construct it 
to meet  up-to-date energy codes and standards.  It takes  many years for energy -
efficient building technologies, processes, and materials to progress through the 
steps of design, development, testing, evaluation, acceptance, and compliance, and 
to reach proven levels of cost-effectiveness before  they are included in the 
International Energy Conservation Code  (IECC). As certain provisions of t he IECC 
become outdated, those sections of the  code are  updated in draft form. Every three 
years, a new version of the IECC is published that incorporates the updates  that 
have taken place in the previous three years.  Once a new code is  published by the 
IECC, the State of Hawai‘i’s  Building Code Council reviews the new code and 
discusses what changes, if any, should be made to the code before it is adopted in 
Hawai‘i. As ex officio voting member and Chair of the State Building Code Council, 
HSEO was instrumental in the Council’s adoption of the 2018 International Energy 
Conservation Code (IECC) with Hawai‘i -specific amendments. HSEO assisted the 
counties in development of their codes and developed the proposed Hawai’i 
amendments to the IECC.   13 
 Also of importance are appliance efficiency standards . In FY2023  HSEO reviewed 
and supported appliance efficiency standards and actively participate d in national 
webinars and meetings of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project ; Act 224 
(2023)  authorizes the Chief Energy Officer to enforce minimum efficiency standards 
and adopt or amend efficiency standards. It sets minimum efficiency standards that 
go into  effect in January of 2025 for portable electric spas, residential ventilating 
fans, toilets, urinals, and water coolers and allows manufacturers  to utilize the 
Home Ventilating Institute's certified products directory certification program to 
meet certain standards.

State agencies * 
Continuing  efforts by HSEO and State agencies to manage the State’s energy use 
have resulted in a long-term reduction of electricity  consumption; i n FY2023, State 
of Hawai‘i buildings consumed a total of 528,171,759 kWh of energy.  This reflects a 
151,261,890 kWh reduction in energy use from the FY2005 baseline of over 679  
million kWh . Taking action to reduce electricity use in government saves energy and 
is essential to reaching greater energy efficiency in Hawai‘i.  
Act 239 (SLH 2022)  requires state facilities to implement cost -effective energy 
efficiency measures.  It also requires the design of all new state building 
construction to maximize energy and water efficiency, maximize energy generation 
potential, and use building materials that reduce the carbon footprint of the project. 
These actions move state governmen t forward to lead by example on reducing 
energy cost by being more efficient.  HSEO also informed state departments about 
House Resolution 198 (2023) which  urges the Governor and state departments to 
investigate opportunities provided by the direct pay provision in the Inflation Reduction Act for solar projects in state facilities. State departments tasked with 
managing facilities, including the Department o f Accounting and General Services, 
Department of Education, and Department of Transportation, are requested to 
designate a point person to prepare for the availability and deployment of the direct 
pay funding for energy systems on state facilities . 
HSEO continues to collaborate with and provide information, training, and technical 
review for government agencies, professional associations, and educational 
institutions in Hawai‘i to reduce energy use and to participate in performance 
contracting and ot her means of financing energy retrofits. In addition to in -house 
expertise, HSEO contracts with technical and contracting experts as well as the USDOE’s national labs to provide in -depth review, analysis, and recommendations , 
and is requesting Federal supp ort for projects to increase  these efforts.   
   Technical Assistance

 Hawaiʻi Green B usiness  Program  
HSEO coordinates the Hawai‘i  Green Business Program  (HGBP), which provides 
technical assistance to businesses and organizations to implement energy and 
resource- efficient practices and recognizes and promotes the success and value of 
the practices during an annual award ceremony.  
In FY23 , the Hawai ’i Green Business Program recognized its largest ever annual 
cohort and expanded to include more small  businesses in rural areas  across the 
state.  The program also recognized, in a formal, live-streamed award s ceremony  at 
the Governor’s office,  a total of 37 businesses, venues, and events for undertaking 
efficiency and sustainable business practices that will help their bottom line while advancing Hawai‘i’s clean energy and sustainability goals.  
The program is more than 20-year partnership between the HSEO, the Department 
of Health, the Board of Water Supply, and the Chamber of Commerce of Hawai‘i.  Expanding the program to include small businesses and organizations in rural areas 
has been initiated with the Clean Energy Wayfinders and supports the Justice 40 
Initiative. Over 150 businesses, organizations, and events have participated and 
have been recognized under this program.   
Energy eﬃciency performance standard s 
Energy efficiency is extremely cost-effective and resource- efficient; it often costs 
less to avoid using a kilowatt -hour (kWh) than it does  to generate or purchase a 
kWh. In formal energy efficiency programs, each dollar spent on efficiency generally 
saves ten times that amount on energy bills.  Energy efficiency is also important as 
a means of reducing the overall amount of land and resources necessary for meeting Hawai‘i’s energy needs.  
Hawai‘ i’s Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS), contained in HRS Section 
269-96, requires the reduction of electricity consumption in Hawai ‘i by 4,300 
gigawatt -hours by 2030. To fund the energy efficiency program, a Public Benefits 
Fee (PBF) surcharge is collected via utility customers’ electricity bills.   
Hawai‘i continues to keep pace with its target goal of reducing electricity demand by 4,300 gigawatt -hours by 2030 through efficiency and conservation measures, 
with significant savings from lighting, cooling (air conditioning), water heating, and 
other measures.    
HSEO was also involved in ongoing discussions to establish an energy efficiency  
goal beyond 2030, that would be in line with 2045 and Hawai‘i ’s 100% renewable 
and clean energy economy decarbonization objectives . As an on-going effort, HSEO 
participates in the Public Utilities Commission’s Public Benefits Fee  Energy Efficiency 
Technical  Assistance Group  and EEPS Technical Working Group , as well in the 
NASEO -NARUC and Hawai‘i  Grid Interactive Efficient Buildings Working Groups , and 
meets regularly with  the Hawai‘i  Green Infrastructure Authority  and the Public 15 
 Benefit s Fee Administrator  to collaborate and coordinate on statewide policies, 
programs, projects , opportunities,  technological updates, and information. 
HSEO has and will apply for and coordinate State activities that support market 
transformation with funding from federal energy programs such as the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 - Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan 
Fund, the Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act Section s 50121 Home Efficiency Rebates , 50122 Home Electrification & 
Appliance Rebates , 50131 Latest and Zero Building Energy Code Adoption , as well 
as other opportunities as they arise .

Renewable Energy Generation/Production 
Introduction  
Hawai‘i  is committed to the use of renewable sources to meet its energy needs for 
three reasons: economics (affordability), environment, and energy security.  
Nationally and internationally, the costs of electricity from renewable resources 
have declined over the years; now, renewable energy is often the lowest cost source.

In Hawai‘i , as existing units are replaced and retired, the cost difference of new 
electricity generation units are even more pronounced, since (as in island and 
remote areas) petroleum, the most expensive of the fossil fuels,3 is the fuel most 
commonly used for electricity generation.

 Hawai‘i’s locally available  renewable resources such as solar and wind  generate 
electricity at significantly less cost than low sulfur fuel oil and diesel typically 
through long term fixed price contracts that blunt the harmful effects of oil price 
volatility. Hydrop ower can also economically compete favorably with fossil fuel 
generation. Recent advances in ocean thermal energy conversion heat exchangers 
show great promise in making that technology cost effective.   
When solar is  combined with energy storage (see energy storage section), 
renewable resources can be shifted to peak power periods to lower the cost of 
electricity while increasing  resiliency and reliability.  
The Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) remains an effective driving force  for 
Hawai‘i’s renewable procurement progress with firm oversight  by the PUC.  HSEO 
will continue to provide analysis,  technical assistance,  and project deployment 
support to developers of  utility -scale and customer -sited renewable energy systems  
as well as other energy stakeholders .  
 
Renewable Portfolio Standard * 
Hawai‘i’s RPS law, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes sections 269 -91 through 95 , serves as a 
legal mandate to achieve a clean energy economy. First enacted in 2001, the RPS has been modified in subsequent years to reflect and refine Hawai‘i’s objective to 
“transition the State away from imported fuels and toward renewable local resources that provide a secure source of affordable energy.
4” 
In 2022, Act 240 (2022) was adopted by the Legislature improved the accuracy of 
the RPS definition based on electrical generation as opposed to sales . Two 
fundamental issues that the change corrected are listed below: 
1. The previous renewable portfolio standard calculation inflated the reported 
percentage of renewable energy by excluding customer -sited, grid- connected 
energy generation in the denominator, which becomes material with higher levels of customer -sited, grid- connected energy generation that is non -
renewable; and 
2. The previ ous electrical energy sales number did  not include energy losses 
that occur red between the points  of electrical energy generation and the 
customer meter, where sales are measured.   
One study projected that without the change an RPS of 100% may have allowed 
21% fossil -fueled generation on the system. The essence of the statutory change is 
shown below, with the new text underlined and the deleted text between brackets. As now required by HRS section 269- 92, each utility is to use renewable energy 
sources for, at a minimum,

A variety of energy sources contributed to generation of  Hawai‘i ’s electricity in 
2022. As shown by the donut chart, fossil fuels were used to generate two -thirds of 
Hawai‘i’s electricity. The next largest amount, at 15%, was provided by small -scale 
solar, followed by wind at 6%, utility -scale solar at 5%, biomass (including 
municipal solid waste) at 4%, geothermal at 2%, and hydropower at 1%.   
 
 
19 
 The amount of electricity generated by fossil fuels has been declining, and the 
amount generated from renewable sources has been increasing, as shown in the 
stacked column graph below. When both utility -provided and customer -generated 
electricity are consi dered, demand has remained relatively constant, at about 10 
terawatt -hours statewide (10,000 gigawatt -hours) per year.  
 
 
The changes in renewable electricity production by source, year over year, are 
shown in the graph below. The fastest growing source was distributed photovoltaics 
(PV), followed by utility -scale PV. Other sources (wind, biomass, hydropower, and 
biofuels) have remained somewhat constant  over the time period of 2012 -2022. 
Geothermal, which was off -line between May of 2018 and November of 2020 due to 
impacts of  lava flow  from an active volcano , returned to full production in 2021.

New renewable energy development  
On O‘ahu, the scheduled retirement on September 1, 2022 , of a 180- MW AES 
owned and operated coal fired power plant that had over its 30 -year contract  
provided 15 -20% of O ‘ahu’ s  power  highlighted  the urgency  of timely 
interconnection of replacement generation . To address the timely substitution of 
generation capacity vacated by the AES coal plant, the  Powering Past Coal Task 
Force was formed by gubernatorial executive order.  D uring FY22 and FY23 , the 
Task Force proactively identified potential project development delays and swiftly 
resolved them when feasible. The Task Force concluded its initial mission and 
established essential channels of communication between developers, agencies, and 
utilities.  
In the latter half of FY23, following the closure of the coal plant and continuing 
work from the Task Force, HSEO continued to maintain a master schedule of power 
generation  including projects on all islands .  The schedule  included  periodic updates 
of the timeline  of projects and programs approved by the PUC, including utility -
scale projects, Community  Based Renewable Energy projects, as well as Battery 
Bonus / Scheduled Dispatch, demand response, and distributed energy resource 
programs.  
In FY23, HSEO also prepared for a greater level of support for a wider variety of 
renewable energy and storage technologies, including solar, wind, geothermal, 
bioenergy, hydropower, and ocean energy (including wave and ocean thermal 
energy conversion, “OT EC”), all of which are included in HSEO’s presentations, 
permitting resources, and public outreach materials.  
Project support will continue in FY24, as projects undergoing construction continue 
towards commercial operation; also, in FY24, the projects that bid in to the third 
Request for Proposals will  be announced and will proceed through contracting, 
permitting,  and Public Utilities  Commission approvals.

Both utility -scale and customer -sited solar PV generation are needed to meet 
Hawai ‘i’s renewable energy and electricity affordability objectives.  In calendar year 
2022 in Hawai ‘i over 2.18 terawatt -hours  of electricity we re produced from both 
utility scale and distributed PV.  
In FY23, HSEO provided coordination where necessary for Hawaiian Electric’s Stage 1 and 2 projects through meetings with utilities and stakeholders, technical and feasibility review and comment, and evaluation of policies and impacts.

Permitting support  
HSEO has been actively involved in working with developers and permitting officials 
to find and create improvements to the approval process for renewable energy. 
Appropriate siting, knowledge of technologies, resources, locations, and impacts, 
and finding sustainab le solutions to complex issues , are essential to successful 
public policies and initiatives. The timely permitting of utility -scale renewable 
energy projects, including environmental review and community support, will be 
key to meeting the state’s decarbon ization goals on schedule.  
HSEO's online permitting wizard has been updated to reflect current  requirements 
of Federal, State and County permits needed for new projects .  HSEO staff has 
communicated with project developers and officials of the City and County of 
Honolulu on permitting issues that have hindered the approval process for both 
utility -scale and customer -sited solar PV generation  and batteries and has assisted 
in researching successful approaches from other jurisdictions . In some areas, 
improvements recently implemented a re expected to shorten the permitting 
process from months to weeks.  
HSEO is currently seeking federal funding to support the systematic review and improvement of utility -scale renewable energy projects, with the aim of facilitating 
community benefit and support during the permitting process.

Onshore  Wind 
There are currently eight onshore wind farms in Hawai ‘i, that collectively produce 
626 GWh of electricity.  
Concerns with the proximity of wind turbines to homes, schools, and other occupied 
buildings have prompted calls for revision to County regulations. For example, in 
FY23 the Honolulu City Council considered increasing the minimum distance 
between wind turbines and areas zoned for  occupied buildings.  O‘ahu’s  current 
setback requirements are for the setback distance to be equal to the turbine height.

Bioenergy 
Bioenergy includes biomass (wood chips and other solid fuels, including municipal 
solid waste) and biofuels (liquid or gaseous fuels, including biodiesel, sustainable 
aviation fuel, ethanol, and renewable natural gas).   
Biomass and biofuels are both forms of stored energy, since they can be kept for 
days, weeks, or months, and used when needed.   However, these fuels  offer small 
improvements in carbon output over the fossil fuels it is intended to replace.   
Technological innovation will be required to make biofuels cost competitive with low sulfur fuel oil and diesel in power generation.

 Grid Resilience, Security & Modernization 
Introduction 
Hawai‘i understands there is a new normal with wildfires. With clear recognition 
that Hawai'i's wet and dry periods are more pronounced, Hawai ‘i's wildfire risk is on 
par with threats posed by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis under our 
"all-hazards" approach to resilience.  
HSEO exerts its energy policy and resilience planning role serving as the primary 
and coordinating agency for State Emergency Support Function 12: Energy (SESF -
12) within FEMA’s National Disaster Recovery Framework , through participation in 
regulatory proceedings and through coordination of applications for, and 
administration of , federal grants for resiliency and response planning and 
investments . 
Energy Assuranc e 
HSEO works diligently to ensure the uninterrupted availability and delivery of 
reliable fuel and electric al energy to support economic recovery and meet the 
demands of a growing, clean economy. In this role, the Energy Office  supports 
energy assurance  through  its role as the primary and coordinating agency for State 
Emergency Support Function 12: Energy (SESF -12). SESF-12 assist s the State  to 
respond to and recover  from “all hazards,” including hurricanes , tsunamis, volcanic 
eruptions, wildfires,  pandemics , and humanmade threats .  
This year, SESF -12 was activated for Tropical Storm Calvin and the devastating 
wildfires on Maui. During emergency  activations, SESF- 12 interfaces with energy 
industry operators to understand the broader energy supply situation, anticipate 
shortages, and coordinate with other ESFs, industry, and emergency management 
to address any energy issues. During “blue skies” , SESF -12 provides subject -matter 
expertise, develops,  and maintains the SESF -12 Annex to the State’s Emergency 
Operations Plan  as well as the State’s Energy Security Plan, and develops and  
participates  in training and exercises.   
   Technical Assistance  
Energy Resilience  
HSEO has pursued federal funding to invest in and deploy projects that increase 
energy system resilience and further develop a robust COP. There are many 
opportunities from annual programs as well as IIJA and IRA funding, and HSEO has 
had successful applications and awards from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency ’s (FEMA) Hazard Mitiga tion Grant Program (HMGP)  and Building Resilient 
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) as well as the Department of Energy’s Grid 25 
 Resilience Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) and 40101(d) Grid Resilience funding 
programs .  
Working with HI -EMA, HSEO had secured a $600,000 grant under FEMA HMGP to 
assess the energy supply chain on O’ahu and the interdependencies of Community 
Lifelines — FEMA -defined customers that provide essential services in response to 
and recovery from all -hazards events —such as first responders, hospitals, water, 
and wastewater. This project ( Advance Assistance  1.0) concluded in October 2023. 
HSEO will receive $450,000 through FEMA BRIC set -aside funding to do the same 
assessment (Advance Assistance 2.0) fo r the other counties.  
The Energy Office completed the O‘ahu Energy System and Critical Infrastructure 
Vulnerability and Resiliency Assessment, a FEMA Advance Assistance- funded effort. 
This assessment of O‘ ahu's primary energy supply, distribution, and demand 
networks and the State's critical infrastructure risks covered electricity, liquid, and 
gas infrastructure and the dependencies of Community Lifeline Key Customers.  
Twenty -eight energy hazard mitigatio n measures were identified in this effort with a 
five-year implementation  plan to improve the resiliency of critical energy 
infrastructure. The Energy Office has secured funding, pending FEMA approval, for a 
second analysis phase for Kaua‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i counties.  
HSEO, in collaboration with HECO, also submitted a successful application to FEMA BRIC's National Competition for three Critical Customer Hubs (CCH) in Windward 
O‘ahu, bringing in $8.33 million federal dollars to build resiliency into the system. 
CCHs are areas with several Community Lifeline customers nearby. The local grid 
can be reconfigured to a microgrid powered by mobile generation, allowing 
Community Lifelines t o continue operating and serving the local community during 
a longer -duration outage. The CCH project was the first National Competition award 
for Hawai‘i .  
HSEO was deemed the sole entity for Hawai‘i to receive, administer, and distribute 
IIJA Section 40101(d) funding for grid resilience and preventing outages. The 
program will run for five years and bring over $15 million in investment to the 
State. The planning work done under both Advance Assistance projects will inform 
the criteria, metrics, and evaluation of 40101(d) project proposals.   
The Energy Office served on the Resilience Working Group from 2019 through 2021 
under Hawaiian Electric's Integrated Grid Planning process with oversight by the 
Hawai‘i  PUC. The Working group considered hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, 
volcanos, wildfires, and physical and cyber -attacks the greatest threats to grid 
resilience and recommended a set of resilience measures.  
The Working Group emphasized that infrastructure owners and operators must collaborate in close partnerships to coordinate disaster planning and recovery with 
shared responsibilities between the power companies, key customers, and the 
government. The final  consolidated Integrated Grid Plan Report was submitted to 26 
 the Hawai‘i  PUC by Hawaiian Electric on May 12, 2023 and is under review by the 
PUC.  
   Technical Assistance  
Grid Modernization  
HSEO,  in partnership with KIUC, will receive more than $17.9 million in funding 
through the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program.  
Both projects leverage existing power generation equipment with new technology to 
expand dispatchable renewable energy and support reliable island grid operation, 
among other benefits. Together, these solutions will enable KIUC to achieve its 100% renewabl e energy goal within the next ten years.  
The projects are scheduled to begin in early 2024, with an estimated completion date in mid -2025.  
The GRIP program will partly fund the Utility Solar Grid Forming Technology 
(USGFT) and Synchronous Condenser Conversion Technology (SCCT) demonstration 
projects .  
Utility Solar Grid Forming Technology (USFGT)  
The USFGT project involves an innovative technology application demonstrating a 
technological solution for expanded renewables dispatch and reliable island grid 
operation. The project adds battery storage and advanced grid -forming inverters to 
two existing  solar power plants. This will create a hybrid power supply with 
enhanced dispatchability and greater resource availability and provide critical 
ancillary services, including frequency regulation, reactive power and voltage 
control, and operating reserves.  The grid regulation service will offer significant 
regional and community benefits by furthering the capability of the system to 
accommodate 100% dispatch of renewable generation sources and provide a more 
reliable and resilient island grid.  
The GRIP program will provide half of the total cost -shared project, estimated at 
$32.5 million, with KIUC contributing the other half of the total project cost.  
Synchronous Condenser Conversion Technology  
This innovative project adds the grid-forming capability to an existing Port Allen 
power station generator to accommodate the stable operation of high penetration 
distributed variable renewable generation on the Kaua‘i electric grid. The project 
will provide significant regional and community benefits by reducing the likelihood 
and consequence of disruptive events to the grid and provide a reference case for 
others' duplication of the conversion technology. This novel use of grid- forming 
technology in a siz e grid will demonstrate a replicable solution for local, regional, 
and interregional grid enhancement and decarbonization.  27 
 The GRIP program will provide half the cost -shared project of $3.35 million, with 
KIUC contributing the remaining half of the total project cost.  
Hawaiian Electric was awarded $95 million through the same program to support 
the company’s proposed five- year resilience plan, which includes a slate of initial, 
foundational grid resilience investments as the first phase of a long -term climate 
adaptation effort.

 Clean Transportation  
Introduction 
Decarbonizing the transportation sector is central to the State's commitment to 
achieving a clean energy economy no later than 2045. The Energy Office has prioritized efforts supporting transformational investment in Hawai‘ i's clean energy 
economy, such as electrifying government fleet vehicles, providing market signals, developing innovative market offerings, and supporting the buildout of backbone 
infrastructure. Whenever possible, HSEO seeks opportunities to leverage funding sources to maximize the impact of clean transportation efforts.   
 
Advancing Zero- Emission Vehicles (ZEVs)  
The availability of zero -emission vehicles (ZEVs) for purchase and the accessibility 
of charging stations are significant factors for improving clean ground 
transportation. HSEO has pursued opportunities to send market signals to vehicle 
manufacturers and lessors to increase the availability of ZEVs for purchase and rent 
throughout the State. The light -duty (passenger) vehicle market is beginning to see 
ZEVs priced on par with their gas -powered equivalents, even before considering any 
regional subsidies and lower operating costs.  
National EV Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI)  
The IIJA provides both formula and competitive program dollars for states to build 
out ZEV infrastructure. HSEO has supported HDOT in developing an implementation 
plan required by the NEVI Formula Program. HDOT is implementing the plan to 
complete the infrastructu re deployment along existing Alternative Fuel Corridors 
(AFCs) with NEVI formula funds and HSEO’s support.  Completing the AFCs i s an 
initial step  in building out the necessary infrastructure to support the 
decarbonization of the ground transportati on sector.   
   Technical Assistance  
 
The Charging and Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program  (CFI) 
Unlike NEVI, the CFI is a competitive electric vehicle  (EV) charging program under 
the IIJA. Administered by the US. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA), the program consists of Community Charging and Fueling 
Program Grants, which prioritizes project locations for community, equity, 
workforce, and climate benefits and Alternative Fuel Corr idor Program Grants, 
which prioritizes project locations within 1 -5 miles of a n AFC. HSEO has 
collaborated with HDOT to develop an application u nder the Corridor Program. If 
approved, this would fund a fast charger on Moloka‘i island and use Volkswagen 29 
 settlement funds administered by HSEO for the 20% cost match.  HSEO and HECO 
also partnered with HDOT on its Community Charging application under the CFI 
program to install chargers at nine public libraries statewide.   
   Technical Assistance  
 
Volkswagen Settlement Activities * 
Light Duty Zero Emission Vehicle Supply Equipment  
Per the Volkswagen Settlement Environmental Mitigation Trust, the State of Hawai ʻi, 
as a Beneficiary of the Trust, will use 15 percent of its total allocation of trust funds 
on eligible costs for Light Duty Zero Emission Vehicle Supply Equipment (Eligible 
Mitigation Action #9). Per Hawaiʻ i's Beneficiary Mitigation Plan (Section 6.3.2), 
HSEO submitted a funding request to allocate $1,218,750 of Trust funds to contribute towards the purchase, installation, and maintenance of light -duty electric 
vehicle charging stations, which may include a mix of Level 2 chargers and DC fast 
chargers.  
The program will focus on locations available to the public at government -owned 
properties, workplaces or that support charging network connectivity. The EV 
charging stations will help to expand Hawai‘ i's statewide EV charging network and 
support the State's fleet electrification efforts. As noted above, HSEO and HDOT 
applied to fund a NEVI -compliant charger on Moloka‘i to complete the buildout of 
the corridor. HSEO proposes to use VW settlement funds t o provide the non -federal 
matching share for the program at a maximum of 20% of the total project cost, or 
$744,884.00, to access roughly $3 million of federal funds . HSEO actively looks to 
leverage the VW Settlement funds to bring in additional federal and private sector 
funding and develop partnerships to increase the scale of the impact.

Diesel Replacement Rebate  
HSEO signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Hawai ʻi Department of  Health 
(HDOH) for the development and administration of the Diesel Replacement Rebate 
(DRR) to offer rebates to private and public fleet owners looking to replace medium-duty diesel vehicles and equipment with zero- emission equivalents. HSEO 
is responsible for developing and administrating the DRR rebate program, and 
HDOH is accountable for paying participant support costs to the Diesel Emission 
Reduction Act (DERA) program beneficiaries for successfully procuring eligible 
vehicles through the DRR. The program opened on October 29, 2021, and has 
received numerous applications. HSEO has funds reserved for six projects and has 
paid out and closed two rebates for electric school buses. This ongoing program receives additional grant funding through the DERA program each year. 30 
 Significantly HSEO uses the VW settlement funds to match the annual funds HDOH 
receives from the EPA through the Diesel Emission Reduction Act  for which Hawai‘i 
receive an additional fifty percent matching incentive from the EPA. The result is a program two hundred and fifty percent the size of what the DRR program would have otherwise been.

Hawaiʻ i Zero Emission Bus Program  
HSEO is continuing to work with HDOT, the County of Kaua‘i,  the County of Maui, 
and the County of Hawai‘ i on a program to replace up to 12 MHD diesel buses with 
battery -electric zero- emission equivalent buses. HSEO, working in collaboration 
with the partners, leveraging V W Settlement funds with Federal Transit 
Administration (FTA) Low -No grant applications proposing to replace aging diesel 
transit buses that are beyond their useful life with battery electric transit buses with 
supporting charging infrastruc ture. DOT can distribute FTA formula funds from FY 
19, 20, and 21 and Low -No grants from 2018 and 2021 towards projects that 
replace diesel buses with electric buses. The collaboration between agencies and 
the counties allows for a larger program than what otherwise could have been 
achieved.

EV Infrastructure  
HSEO has also advocated for the State's energy and decarbonization goals at 
relevant venues and departments, including the Public Utilities Commission and 
legislature. HSEO participates in the PUC Docket 2021 -0173 related to a $ 79M 
expansion of Hawaiian Electric’s EV charging network. The company’s application is 
built upon the Electric Vehicle Critical Backbone Study, which HSEO provided input. 
HSEO participation in the docket includes providing a broad perspective on  the 
federal IIJA NEVI and CFI programs , regulatory programs, legislative ly enacted EV 
charging rebate program, and needed 3rd party capital investments that will be 
needed to fill the gap in charging infrastructure needs in the 2030 and 2045 
timeframes . Given the material gap in charging infrastructure  between needed and

 Expanding Transportation Choices   
Significant progress has been made on vehicle efficiency standards, but more needs 
to be made to reduce the amount of energy that is used in Hawai‘i  to power 31 
 transportation. V ehicle miles travelled, or VMT , is one metric  used to quantify how 
much we drive. Since 2000, VMT in Hawai‘i  has increased by almost 40%, and in 
2022, about 11.1 billion miles were driven in Hawai‘i .  
Although both active and shared transportation and electric vehicles help to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and improve local air quality, active and shared modes of 
transportation have additional benefits. Regarding the need for reducing the energy 
required for transportation , a simple 100% conversion to electric vehicles will 
require a significant increase in the land required for renewable energy to power 
everyone's vehicles. The space required for vehicles includes the roads driven on 
and where cars are parked at home or when shopping, recreating, and more. This is 
particularly important in land -constrained places like Hawai‘i , where land might be 
more efficiently allocated for open space, agriculture, and affordable housing, 
among other uses.   
In addition, active and shared transportation have other co- benefits including :   
 Reduced consumer -borne costs like owning and operating a vehicle and 
residential parking land value.   
 Public- borne costs like construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, 
indirect social and economic costs such as injuries and fatalities, congestion, 
parking subsidies, and land value costs.   
For Hawai‘i  to transition to a carbon net negative economy equitably, more 
investments must be made to improve the transportation infrastructure and 
services that help encourage people to make more of their trips via walk, roll, bike, 
and public transportation. HSEO supports the expansion of transportation choices 
through the following efforts:   
 
Multi-modal Assessment Phase 1 and 2  
HSEO was awarded funding by the O‘ahu Metropolitan Planning Organization to 
conduct a multi- modal assessment. The Phase 1 goal of the O‘ahu  Multi-modal 
Assessment (MMA) is to identify specific land -use and transportation needs and 
projects to reduce vehicle miles traveled for the island of O‘ahu . In Phase 2, the 
MMA will take the recommended projects in Phase one and prepare them for 
inclusion in the Transportation Improvement Program. Phase two will also include 
the development of quantifiable metrics that can be used in the MPO's projec t 
selection and prioritization for the Transportation Improvement Program to improve 
multi- modal accessibility for people walking, rolling, biking, and using transit.   
The study is expected to start in spring 2024.

Oʻahu Mobility Hub Study  
HSEO co- manages the O‘ahu  Mobility Hub Study with the State Climate 
Commission. The study aims to identify possible candidate sites for mobility hubs 
on state -owned parking lots. A mobility hub is a  centralized location that integrates 
various transportation options and services to facilitate seamless and convenient 
travel for individuals. The goal of a mobility hub is to enhance connectivity between 
different modes of transportation, promote sustain able and efficient travel, and 
improve the overall mobility experience. The scope of the study includes a parking 
inventory, site suitability analysis and prioritization, typology development, and an 
implementation guide. During FY 2023, the parking inventory began, a draft of the 
site suitability and prioritization methodology was devel oped, and one technical 
working group meeting with other government stakeholders was held. In the first 
half of FY 2024, significant progress has been made on the parking inventory, the 
site suitability and prioritization were completed, one technical working group 
meeting was held, and the typologies and implementation guide are being worked 
on. The study is expected to be completed before the end of FY 2024.

Shift Worker Transportation Demand Management Project  
HSEO co-project managed the Shift Worker Transportation Demand Management 
Project (TDM) with the Hawaiʻ i Department of Health (HDOH). The project aims to 
identify transportation solutions for an often-forgotten segment of the population in 
transportation planning: people who don't work "traditional hours". The project will 
set the groundwork to prepare to pilot equitable TDM strategies with community 
consensus and provide valuable input to government agencies. Th is will help to 
33 
 ensure that the needs and experiences of communities disparately impacted by 
greenhouse gas emissions and disparities in access to transportation facilities or 
services are represented in future TDM programs and that they do not exclude or unduly burden chronically  exploited communities.  
During FY 2023, HSEO and HDOH reviewed and finalized the literature review of 
existing TDM supportive strategies and national best practices, pilot site 
prioritization process, and facilitated three working group meetings to solicit feedback. In addition, two community -based organizations (CBOs) were hired to 
engage with the prioritized communities. As part of supporting the CBOs, HSEO and 
HDOH reviewed and provided feedback on a travel trends analysis, survey 
questions, and public engagement memo, facilitated three meetings with the CBOs, 
and provided graphic design support. During the first half of FY 2024, HSEO and 
HDOH reviewed and provided feedback on the CBOsʻ  summary and

other states, the District of Columbia, and Quebec. The MDHD MOU commits 
signatories to foster a self -sustaining market for zero -emission medium and heavy -
duty vehicles. The Sign atory States agree to strive to make sales of all new 
medium - and heavy -duty vehicles in their jurisdictions zero- emission vehicles by no 
later than 2050.   
To ensure adequate progress toward the 2050 goal, the Signatory States will strive 
to make at least 30 percent of all new medium- and heavy -duty vehicle sales in 
their jurisdictions zero -emission vehicles by no later than 2030. Each Signatory 
State will re port, within its available capabilities and on a schedule agreed to by the 
states, medium and heavy -duty vehicle registration data needed to track progress 
toward meeting these targets.   
The need to track progress is one of the activities supported by HSEO’s goals to 
develop an energy data governance framework discussed below. In 2025, the 
Signatory States agree to assess progress toward meeting the 2030 and 2050 
targets and determine whet her an adjustment to the 2030 interim sales target is 
appropriate. The Task Force developed a multi -state action plan to identify barriers 
and propose solutions to support widespread electrification of medium - and heavy -
duty vehicles (Zero Emission Medium and Heavy -Duty Vehicle Action Plan). The 
plan was released in July 2022 after public input and stakeholder feedback.  It

 Energy Storage Systems 
Introduction 
As Hawai‘i  brings its energy supplies (renewable energy) and energy demand (use 
of electricity and fuels) into balance, energy storage systems – including  synthetic 
inertia (to balance out momentary fluctuations), batteries and  pumped storage 
hydro (to balance out hourly or daily fluctuations), hydrogen, biofuels, and  electro -
fuels (for transportation and offsite energy use) and  bioenergy (to balance seasonal 
demands) – are becoming increasingly important.  
Hawai‘i  is leading the way in many respects.  The U.S. Department of Energy’s 
Annual Energy Outlook for 2023 shows an electricity system reference case in 2050 
that has striking similarities to Hawai‘i’s electricity system in the near term.  
 
 
 
Batteries  
Batteries are used in both large - and small -scale electricity production to smooth 
out and provide a balance between electricity production and demand. As of mid -
2023 there were  over 20,000 customer -sited batteries (with a capacity of over 1 66 
MW) directly supporting more than  100,000  photovoltaic systems in Hawai‘i.  There 
are also several utility -scale projects that include batteries, totaling  690 MWh of 
storage capacity. The amount of battery energy storage on Hawai‘i’s grids will 
continue to increase.

Hawaiʻi Paciﬁc Hydrogen Hub* 
The Hawai‘i State Energy Office convened a group of stakeholders to develop and 
submit an ultimately unsuccessful  $2.1 billion proposal to the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Clean Hydrogen Hub program.  
The Hawai‘i proposal aligned existing and new infrastructure to build out a new 
green regional hydrogen production, distribution, and use network to serve the 
state and military locations on Guam and Kwajalein Atoll. The Hub proposed to seed 
a transition t o green hydrogen -powered operations across all sectors of Hawai‘i’s 
energy ecosystem and economy for the next decade to:  
Eliminate price volatility and reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions in 
high-value transportation, energy storage, and electric power applications;  
Serve as the linchpin in accelerating Hawai‘i’s renewable energy and decarbonization strategy, thus contributing to energy security and national security;  
Provide significant net benefits to Hawai‘i’s diverse communities through green jobs, higher wages, and delivery of reliable, secure, clean, and affordable energy;   
Match and phase in appropriate end users from ground- transportation, maritime, 
and aviation sectors operating locally to ensure supply and demand balance and  
Focus on hard- to-electrify or hard- to-abate sectors first, including heavy -duty 
ground, marine transportation, and aviation.  
While it was disappointing not to be selected for inclusion in the national program, 
HSEO gained considerable knowledge through the process that could accelerate the 
development of green hydrogen in Hawai‘i for use in critical energy resilience 
application s and heavy -duty trucks and buses. The Energy Office will continue to 
pursue the development of the most promising opportunities and financial support 
from other federal funds and available resources.

Bioenergy, Biomass, and Biofuels  
Energy Feedstock Program *  
Fuels, as forms of stored energy, are essential parts of Hawai‘i’s current energy systems and are important to Hawai‘i’s energy future as well.  
The Energy Feedstock Program ( HRS section 141 -9
) requires both HSEO and the 
Hawai‘i State Department of Agriculture to “maintain cognizance of” local 
37 
 developments in the area of energy feedstocks and report to the Legislature. This 
section is provided in compliance with the statute.  
Energy feedstock activities in the state in FY23 included aviation fuel, feedstock, crop research, economic feasibility, and land suitability studies by the Hawai’i  
Natural Energy Institute; feedstock work, fuel production, and fuel distribution by Pacific Biodiesel; use of biomass for power production by the Mahipapa  facility on 
Kaua‘i ; development of a facility by Aloha Carbon to convert locally -generated 
wastes into organic fertilizer and renewable power; continued use by Hawai’i Gas of 
methane from the Honouliuli  Wastewater Treatment Plant for use in the utility gas 
product delivered via pipeline on O‘ahu; and continued interest in oilseeds by Terviva.  S ince fuel production may be more cost -effective when using materials left 
over from the manufacture of other higher value products (food, feed, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc.), it is not necessary for crops to be dedicated to energy production in order to be relevant as potential energy feedstocks.  
The Hawai‘i  Natural Energy Institute
 continued work on numerous alternative fuels 
projects, including as a member of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) team, conducting research on feedstocks 
and technologies for the production of sustainable aviation fuels. Potential 
feedstocks include construction and demolition waste streams , Leucaena, 
Eucalyptus, Pongamia, Kukui , Kamani, Sorghum, B anagrass, Jatropha, and others. 
Pongamia shows promise and was studied further. Technical production potentials were calculated, by island, and compared with annual jet fuel demand (as of 2018). 
The highest potential was (generally) from trees, with the technical sustainable 
aviation fuels  potential on Maui at nearly 20%; on Kaua‘i , over 40%; Hawai‘i, 
100%; and O‘ahu, less than 2%.  
The only biodiesel producer in the state, Pacific Biodiesel, uses a combination of 
used cooking oil and oils from sustainable agriculture to support its annual 
production of nearly 6 million gallons biodiesel on Hawai‘i Island.  In 2023, the 
company began a project to demonstrate biodiesel produced in Hawai‘i  (on Kaua‘i ) 
from locally grown oilseed cover crops.  This project builds upon Pacific Biodiesel’s previous research in its Hawai‘i  Military Biofuel Crop Project (2011 to 2015).  
According to Pacific Biodiesel, plantings for the 2022 and 2023 harvest seasons 
continued year -round with regenerative farming practices including efficient center -
pivot irrigation utilizing surface water, low -till practices, rotational cover cropping 
(to sequester carbon and improve soil health), and no herbicides or pesticides.  
Pacific Biodiesel also makes its fuel available to wholesale and retail purchasers.  
With U.S. Department of Agriculture grant funding, Pacific Biodiesel installed several 
off-grid biodiesel fueling stations. With support of the Hawai‘i Board of Land and 
Natural Resources, the first station was installed at the Ma‘alaea Harbor on Maui in June 2022, the second station was installed at Honokōhau Small Boat Harbor on 
Hawai‘i Island in July 2022, and the third station was installed in Kahului, Maui in November of 2022.  All of these stations offer both on -road and off -road fuel, with 38 
 the harbor stations providing access for diesel powered marine vessels, including 
tour boats, to fuel up with local biodiesel.   
The Mahipapa  biomass- to-energy facility on Kaua‘i was purchased from the Green 
Energy Team by Mahipapa, LLC, a project of Pacific Current, on July 1, 2022. The 
facility is powered 100% by eucalyptus wood chips. According to the Energy 
Information Administration (EIA),  in the calendar  year 2022 (the most recent data 
available), the facility used about 102,000 tons of wood to generate 52 gigawatt -
hours of electricity for use by Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative.  
The production of electricity from waste (primarily municipal refuse derived fuel) continued at H-POWER  on O‘ahu. According to the EIA, in calendar year 2022 (the 
most recent data available) the facility used over 678,000 tons to generate about 
366 gigawatt -hours of electricity.  
Renewable natural gas continues to be produced by Hawai‘i Gas  at its renewable 
natural gas facility using biomethane from the City and County of Honolulu’s 
Hono‘uli‘uli  wastewater treatment plant. Renewable natural gas produced at the 
facility is injected into the existing Hawai‘i Gas pipeline and mixed with synthetic natural gas, produced from petroleum by -product naphtha, to serve Hawai‘i Gas 
customers. According to the annual report
 filed by Hawai’i  Gas, “ In 2022, Hawai’i  
Gas upgraded 288,734 therms of biogas to biomethane from the Hono‘uli‘uli WWTP 
Biogas Project. Hawai‘i Gas and the City & County of Honolulu are also in the 
process of extending the contract from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2034. ”  
A contract extension would be subject to approval by the Public Utilities 
Commission. 
In FY 2023, progress was made on a project by Aloha Carbon to convert several 
types of organic wastes (invasive species biomass from landscape restoration and 
fire break activities, landscaping and tree trimming waste, wood from construction 
and demolition) into gasification -compatible feedstock, to make energy and 
products such as organic fertilizer in a Sustainable Materials Recovery & Fertilizer 
Facility. This builds upon a previous award of a Federal Small Business Innovation 
Research Grant to the company to gasify biomass waste into green hydrogen and 
sustainable aviation fuel. Recent articles  and postings indicate continued progress 
by Terviva in developing Pongamia for use in food production.   
Although not energy feedstock per se, in May, 2023, Par Hawai‘i  received approval 
from the U.S. Department of Commerce to use renewable feedstocks to produce 
renewable fuels, to include renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and naphtha, at the refinery.
5 In addition, many other projects and discussions occurred 
regarding crops and wastes that could be directed to the production of energy; and 
interest continued in forest biomass, soil carbon, and carbon sequestration.

 Energy Sector Governance  
Introduction  
Effective  energy sector  governance serves as the linchpin for shaping energy 
policies, fostering transparency, and mitigating risks . Simultaneously, ensuring 
equitable access to  clean energy resources is a moral and socio -economic 
imperative, addressing issues of poverty, social inequality, and environmental 
justice.  
HSEO , by statute, promotes  policies and practices to support energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, and clean transportation. This includes the critical support 
functions required to implement these activities throughout Hawai‘i’s economy. 
Workforce development, community engagement, data collection and analysis, and 
regional partnerships are essential to achieving Hawai‘i’s equitable clean energy 
future.  
U.S. Department of Energy in Hawaiʻi*  
The historic U.S. Department of Energy and Hawai‘i  clean energy partnership has 
provided human and financial resources  and technical assistance that has 
effectively established Hawai’i as a national leader in decarbonization and 
renewable energy policy and deployment.   
In 2023, incoming HSEO Chief Energy Officer  Glick engaged leaders in academia,  
state government , and the U.S. Department of Energy  to joint ly develop a 
conceptual structure and agenda for a regional resilience and energy security  
focused accelerator for energy transition. With the working title of  “Pacific Resilient 
Energy Security Transition Accelerator ” or PRESTA , the idea for a joint state -
university -US Department of Energy -supported  technical assistance center to 
catalyze and accelerate optimal energy r estoration of Maui and replicable energy 
security transitions throughout the Hawaiian archipelago  was initiated . PRESTA  is 
envisioned as  a cross -disciplinary team of dedicated and localized human resource 
capacity in finance, economics, policy,  and engineering to design and manage 
energy transitions from feasibility to deployment, supplemented by the national 
laboratories.  
Advancing decarbonization in the integrated energy ecosystem (electrical grid and 
transportation infrastructure) requires sustained support to achieve sustainable 
transformation in the integrated business system chain. Difficult challenges that 
require mul ti-disciplinary, sustained collaboration between government and 
academia under PRESTA w ould initially focus on  the following:  
1) Options for Post Maui Wildfire energy system design and energy transition 
acceleration.  40 
 2) Reducing the average  renewable energy project approval t imeline from five 
to three  years.  
3) RE/BESS management  design and demonstration facilities  for Li-ion and PV 
panel waste streams .  
4) Accelerating the pace of renewable integration in low inertia grids . 
5) Resiliency hub energy self-sufficiency.  
6) Energy -resilient ports/shipping corridors . 
The HSEO Chief Energy Officer presented the PRESTA agenda to the Deputy 
Secretary of Energy in February and July of 2023 and had follow -up meetings with 
the Director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of State and Community Energy Programs on potential USDOE funding for PRESTA. The ongoing dialogue 
with USDOE fulfills the objective s of HCR 17 (2023 ), in which the Hawai‘i House  of 
Representatives  requested HSEO to engage the USDOE regarding a permanent 
presence in the state, and to report “on the status of the engagement and the 
terms of any proposed agreement .”  
In addition to permitting and community acceptance, HSEO and USDOE are engaged in continued dialogue on the following energy transition priorities:  
• Pumped Storage Hydroelectric development . 
• Carbon sequestration resource characterization and development . 
• Geothermal electricity resource characterization and development . 
• Geothermal air conditioning feasibility and education . 
• Wayfinders program development  and potential as a national model.  
• Net zero energy ready building codes adoption and enforcement . 
• State building energy efficiency . 
• Community solar, especially how to benefit low -income households and 
renters.

Decarbonization Pathways Study  
The 2022 Legislature directed the Hawai‘i State Energy Office to “determine 
Hawai‘i's pathway to decarbonization and identify challenges, opportunities, and 
actions that will be needed to achieve those goals.”  
HSEO has contracted with an outside consulting firm and the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory to develop and run scenarios that explore different pathways to 
2045. The outcomes will provide policymakers with data to understand various 
options' economic and societal impacts, including environmental justice 
considerations related to frontline and low -income communities.  
41 
 HSEO gathered input from critical stakeholders statewide and held webinars to 
inform the public of its progress. The final report will be submitted to the 
Legislature 20 days before the start of the session.  
Community Engagement       Market Transforma�on  
 
Workforce Development  
Recognizing the strong connection between community involvement and workforce 
development, in July 2023 HSEO established a new Jobs and Outreach Branch 
(JOB) focused on these two priorities.  HSEO is investing in a sustainable energy 
workforce ecosystem to meet the needs of Hawai‘i  laborers and industry while 
creating pathways to living wage jobs and careers in some of our most economically 
distressed and climate- vulnerable rural and urban communities. The lack of quality 
career opportunities has caused many  of Hawai‘i's young and experienced talent to 
seek careers out of state. In response, Hawai‘i's public and private leaders have 
invested in workforce development for high -demand industries, including clean 
energy and transportation.  
HSEO's workforce development efforts are focused on:  
• Keiki to career education and development  
• Partnerships  
• Leveraging existing Hawai‘i  resources and programs  
• Maximizing federal funds  
• Employer -lead identification of workforce development priorities  
• Developing new programs through UHCC or other partners  
• Enabling job placement and advancement including internships, externships, 
and apprenticeships (e.g., Hawai‘i  Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations Registered Apprenticeships program)  
Good Jobs Hawaiʻi  
HSEO is the clean energy and skilled trades sector lead under the Good Jobs Hawai‘i  
(GJHI) initiative launched in January 2023; a statewide coalition of over 70 
employers, training providers, community -based organizations, and key 
stakeholders focused on developing systemic workforce solutions to ensure quality jobs in strategic economic  sectors. GJHI is led by the University of Hawai‘i  
Community Colleges (UHCC) and the Hawai‘i Chamber of Commerce and is funded 
by various philanthropic and government partners, including the U.S. Department of Commerce - Economic Development Administration, U.S. Department of 
Education, and the Hawai‘i  Workforce Funders Collaborative. GJHI is focused on 
developing “good” quality jobs and careers in four recession -resilient sectors in 
Hawai‘i, including clean energy.  
 As the lead for the clean energy and skilled trades sectors, HSEO has allocated $250,000 for an energy Training Specialist who started on December 1, 2023. 
42 
 HSEO is responsible for convening large local employers in these sectors and 
getting their input on the skills and certifications they desire or require for current 
job openings. These needs are then communicated to UHCC, which can develop 
courses and curricula  to meet these needs or partner with third- party training 
providers. GJHI's training includes Solar Certificate NABCEP, Solar Safety Training 
OSHA-10, commercial driver license, forklift, Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), welding, chainsaw safety, and carpenter pre- apprentice courses. Trainings under 
development through GJHI include International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  
(IBEW) apprenticeship exam preparation, Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP)  and battery energy storage systems  for IBEW members, Certified 
Energy Manager, and GED/ high school equivalency.   
 GJHI metrics for the clean energy and skilled trades sectors as of November 2023:  
 
• Clean Energy / Skilled Trades Trainings Offered: 75 
• Clean Energy / Skilled Trades Trainings Started: 66 
• Clean Energy / Skilled Trades Participants  : 464  
 
   Workforce Development  
 
Clean Energy Sector Partnership  
As part of GJHI, HSEO, in partnership with UHCC, Hawai‘i  Chamber of Commerce, 
SMS Research, and other vital partners, established a new Hawai‘i Clean Energy 
Sector Partnership (CESP) in May 2023. This Sector Partnership is an industry -led 
group of employers, educators, and community organizations that strives to identify 
in-demand entry -level positions and develop career pathways for these positi ons, 
identify desired skills and training resources, provide on -the-job training, and 
support overall employment and career advancement. Through the CESP , HSEO 
partners with employers to identify in -demand entry -level occupations, develop 
career pathways from entry -level jobs, desired skills training, provide on -the-job 
training, and entry -level employment . 
The CESP Steering Committee met four times in 2023, and the first Full CESP 
meeting was in October 2023. More than 80 local industry leaders and community 
partners learned about the CESP and GJHI . They identified training needs and 
priorities in the sector that can be pursued through GJHI and other resources 
available in Hawai‘i.  
In December 2023, HSEO issued a Request for Interest (RFI) for the USDOE Home-
Based Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grant. Through this grant, HSEO is 
allocated $1,194,820 to train local energy efficiency contractor employees to ensure 
there is a sufficient qualifie d workforce to install the energy efficiency technologies 
available for subsidies from USDOE; specifically, the $68 million in Home Efficiency 
Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates  a llocated to Hawai‘ i under 
the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition to training the workforce, HSEO will also be 43 
 responsible for administering Hawai‘ i’s rebates under these programs. The RFI is 
intended to identify potential partners and training programs to be pursued through 
this grant. The CESP has identified energy efficiency training priorities, which will 
help inform the training  developed and provided under this grant.    
   Workforce Development 
 
Energy Education and Keiki -to-Career Pathways  
Workforce development and education start at a young age. Hawai ‘i's youth must 
know the promising careers in Hawai‘i 's energy fields, the required knowledge, and 
skills to enter the workforce, and the available resources to support their career 
development. HSEO has increased its capacity to guide Hawai ‘i’s next generation of 
clean energy leaders by providing technical support and engagement capacity for a variety of programs.  In 2022, HSEO in collaboration with HI DOE contracted the 
Maui Economic Development Board to develop and publish  
clean energy curricula 
and toolkits to  train teachers in primarily Title I K -12 schools in Hawai‘i. These 
publicly -available resources empower teacher, student, and family participation in 
Hawai‘i’s transition to a decarbonized economy.  Over 150 teachers and 8 trainers at 80 Title 1 schools were trained on these materials so they may implement clean energy learning into their individual curriculum and train additional teachers in the 
future. The curriculum has reached over 9,500 students statewide as of the closing 
of the initial project period in July 2022. HSEO has funding allocated for further development of the curriculum.  
 In addition, HSEO serves as an Industry Representative on the Hawai ʻi Department of 
Education ( HIDOE) Career and Technical Education  (CTE) Energy Pathway Advisory 
Council and Energy Pilot Project Team which provides a framework for incorporating career exploration into high school curricula. The Energy Pathway was developed with the support of industry, teachers , and administrative representatives and 
launched its pilot in the 2023 -2024 school year with James Campbell High School, 
Kapolei High School, and Kealakehe High School. The Energy Pathway includes three Programs of Study – (1) Renewable Energy Technologies , (2) 
Alternative 
Fuels Technologies , and (3) Power Grid Technologies  – each leading with a 
Foundations of Energy course in the first year followed by three subsequent 
courses. HSEO supports HIDOE’s CTE program through identification  of industry 
standards and relevant certifications, curriculum development for individual 
teachers, coordination with employers in Hawai ʻi’s energy industry to provide career 
exposure opportunities, and in -class on -campus engagement.

 Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement 
Energize Kākou and Community Outreach  
In 2022, HSEO developed a community education, outreach, and engagement 
program entitled Energize Kākou (together). The program engages and coordinates 
energy stakeholders to increase community awareness about, engagement in, and 
access to decision -making for Hawai’i's  shared energy future. By facilitating 
collaborative government and private sector energy policy and project development 
decision-making throughout Energize Kākou, HSEO proactively addresses critical 
community stakeholder concerns and aspirations to achieve socially and environmentally just and equitable progress toward decarbonization. Energize 
Kākou is an expansive, iterative program developed in partnership with statewide 
community representatives that includes a Cultural Narrative, a Playbook, and a 
Strategic Work Plan along with a user -friendly website and the ground-breaking 
Clean Energy Wayfinders community -based informational resource and workforce 
development program. HSEO has a budget of $100,000 from USDOE (State Energy 
Program) to expand its outreach efforts under Energy Kākou in 2024, which could include additional meetings or workshops, and the development of informational 
materials for the public. 
 
   Community Engagement  
 
Energy Equity Hui  
HSEO currently leads Hawai‘i’s Energy Equity Hui (EEH), a statewide public -private 
collaborative network of individuals and organizations working towards an equitable 
clean energy transition. The EEH has created working groups focused on actionable 
initiatives, including Community Benefits, Renewable Request for Proposal 
Improvements, Equity Frameworks and Definitions, Energy Equity Legislation, and 
EEH Strategy.  The primary outcomes of the working groups to date are letters to 
the PUC detailing research, c ase studies, and recommendations for the following 
steps to improve energy equity issues in Hawai ‘i and the relationship between 
community and energy. 
The PUC opened the Energy Equity and Justice Docket (EEJD) in 2022 to investigate 
how to better integrate equity and justice considerations across Commission 
proceedings and the Commission’s work more broadly, including in its role 
overseeing and regulating the functions of public utilities.  HSEO ’s participation in 
the EEJD is valuable as it informs priority equity needs that can guide other HSEO 
initiatives , e.g., Energize Kākou, Wayfinders, and Energy Equity Hui.  
   Community Engagement

 Strategic Paciﬁc Region Relationship s 
Much can be learned and leveraged by working with other small island developing 
states (SIDS) and nations in the Pacific regarding climate and clean energy issues , 
as similarly faced in  Hawai‘i. In 2023 , HSEO expanded its connections with other 
Pacific Island nations  such as Sāmoa, Palau, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Aotearoa 
(New Zealand), and Australia. The Office has recently made other connections with The Kingdom of Tonga, Pohnpei (Federated States of Micronesia), and the Marshall 
Islands . HSEO will also continue to foster ties with these nations and reach mor e than 
the ones listed above.  HSEO hopes to convene a meeting next year in congruence 
with these collaborations with these SIDS and nations.   
HSEO and the Okinawa Prefectural Government continue to support the Hawai ‘i 
Okinawa Clean Energy Task Force and Workshop. In -person convenings resumed in 
late 2022 with a meeting in Naha, Okinawa, and continued in mid -2023 with an 
event held at the University of Hawai ‘i – Mānoa campus.   
HSEO serves as a Non -Voting Government Member of the Hawaiian Islands 
Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council (SAC) and helps to 
inform the SAC on ocean -related energy matters, namely offshore wind. HSEO also 
supports  the Ocean Resources Management Plan administered by the Hawai‘i Office 
of Planning and Sustainable Development.  
   Community Engagement  
 
Clean Energy Wayﬁnders 
HSEO’s Clean Energy Wayfinders is a nation -leading program that places trained 
individuals in targeted Hawai ‘i communities throughout the state who engage, 
empower, and inform communities on energy and transportation matters. Hawai‘i’s 
rich cultural and historical tradition of wayfinding in which trained navigators help 
lead their communities to a new place where they can sustain a better quality of life  
inspires the Wayfinders’ approach to community engagement . The Wayfinders share 
information and opportun ities for participation in the clean energy transition with 
Hawai ‘i's schools, community organizations, and households — especially those in 
low- to moderate- income (LMI), asset -limited, income -constrained, employed 
(ALICE), and under -resourced communities —  to help increase energy conservation 
and efficiencies, lower month ly energy utility bills, increase access to clean 
transportation and renewable energy resources, promote green career training and 
employment opportunities, and raise awareness about the renewable energy 
policymaking and regulatory process. Kupu Hawai ‘i currently administers the 
Wayfinders through the Kupu 'Āina Corps Program approved by the Hawai‘i State 
Legislature.  46 
 The Wayfinders  program is highlighted in USDOE's General Guidance for Justice40 
Implementation, and USDOE and other state energy offices have approached HSEO 
about implementing similar programs in other jurisdictions.  
Cohort 1 of the Wayfinders ran from September 2022 to September 2023 and 
consisted of eight Wayfinders on Kaua‘i  (1), O‘ahu (3), Moloka‘i (1), Maui (1), and 
Hawai ‘i Island  (2). Cohort 2 runs from October 2023 to October 2024 and consists 
of six (6) Wayfinders based  on Kaua‘i  (1), O‘ahu  (2), Moloka‘i (1), Maui  (1), and 
Hawai ‘i Island  (1). Both cohorts were funded by the USDOE Energy Efficiency and 
Conservation Block Grant ( Kupu host site administration fee) and the American 
Rescue Plan Act through Kupu ‘Āina  Corps ( Wayfinder wages and benefits ). 
The Wayfinders program has found success in its first full program year. The 
Wayfinders have participated as attendees or hosts in over 80 community events, 
including Neighborhood Board meetings, farmers markets, community fairs, school 
classes, and town h all meetings. Through these events the Wayfinders have 
engaged over 1500 individuals, meeting the community where they are to listen to 
their energy concerns and priorities, share relevant energy information and 
program referrals, and help get more people engaged in their local energy conversations.  
In 2023, HSEO partnered with the University of Hawai ‘i Sea Grant College Program 
to train the Wayfinders to support their outreach activities. This project aims to 
develop an extension program through a collaboration between Sea Grant and 
HSEO focused on sustained dialogue and relationship building between i sland 
communities across Hawai ‘i and HSEO in informing the state's energy future. 
Funding for this project ($400,000) comes from the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Professional  development for the Wayfinders is 
essential to their role representing HSEO and their professional  development . UH 
Sea Grant will contract with select community organizations through this project to 
conduct outreach and education on coastal energy matters. This model leverages 
the relationships and expertise of community -based groups and builds their 
capacity beyond the project period.  
In August 2023, HSEO submitted a pre- award application for $1,000,000 in federal 
funding from U.S. Congress to expand the Wayfinders program and increase HSEO’s 
capacity for technical assistance to communities, local regulatory agencies, 
developers, and others engaged in Hawai‘i’s energy transition.  HSEO is evaluating 
extending the existing Wayfinders program in its current form or contracting with community organizations to build community capacity. The expected outcomes are 
to increase HSEO's professional  engagement in community benefits discussions and 
activities; increase community access to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and 
clean transportation resources; increase immediate and long -term employment 
opportunities as a result of market expansion; and accelerate progress toward the 
state's decarbonization goals as set by statute.  47 
 Technical Assistance       Community Engagement  
Sponsorships  
One of the strategies HSEO employs to fulfill its mission is the sponsorship and 
partnership of programs that align with HSEO's mission to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation to help achieve a resilient, 
clean energy econo my. In February and November 2023, HSEO issued separate 
competitive solicitation s seeking applications for programs that increase awareness 
and support of Hawai‘ i's clean energy goals. The type of programs that may be 
sponsored may include, but are not limited to, educational events/programs , 
workforce development events/programs , conferences/summits , seminars , 
workshops , and t rade fairs . Funding for this initiative comes from the USDOE State 
Energy Program.  
Sponsorships from the previous fiscal year (February 2023) were awarded for: Blue 
Planet Foundation’s Sustainable Transportation Coalition of Hawai‘i ($3,500), Clean 
Energy Education ($2,000), Climate and Clean Energy Webinars ($1,000); Hawai‘i 
Bicycling League Bike Month ($8,800); Hawai‘i Climate Change Mitigatio n and 
Adaptation Commission Climate Fairs ($8,950); Hawai‘i Green Growth UN Local2030 Measures Working Group ($8,300), KHON Living 808 ($9,989); Maui 
Economic Development Board Hawai‘i Energy Confe rence ($3,000); and, Renew 
Rebuild Hawai‘i Webinars ($3,500).   
   Community Engagement  
Data Analytics and Visualization  
HSEO is committed to building trust among stakeholders as we progress towards 
our clean energy goals. To support this, HSEO is actively involved in various 
initiatives related to data analysis. High quality analysis and  visualizations improve 
understanding of the underlying data, increase engagement with modeling 
outcomes , and are a resource in decision making.   
Engage Energy System Modeling  
Engage is an open access, publicly available web application for energy system 
modeling developed by HSEO in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory with funding support from the U.S. DOE. It can be used to explore 
decarbonization strategies such as one hundred percent electrification of ground transportation as well as progress in aviation and marine transportation sectors. 
Base models and scenarios were developed for all islands for the Act 238 
Decarbonization Study  to analyze alternat ive pathways . To provide transparency 
and consistency with regulated utility resource planning  proceedings the Engage 
model was  benchmarked to the modeling conducted in HECO’s Integrated Grid  
Planning proceeding. The purpose was to ensure that based on similar assumptions 
the Engage model came up with reasonably similar results and, as necessary,  
48 
 explain any differences in the modeling algorithms that could lead to different 
solution sets. As noted in the executive summary HSEO is working with OMPO on 
their ORTP to translate the transportation planning scenarios into energy system 
requirements of those scenarios to highlight the impacts the transportation 
scenarios could have on topics such as land requirements for renewable energy 
deployment . With the an alytical capacity enabled by Engage,  HSEO will continue to 
work to integrate energy planning with planning of  interdependent sectors  such as 
transportation to support holistic policy analysis as well as provide input in  utility 
regulatory proceedings on issues that could warrant detailed analysis conducted in 
those dockets.

Hawaiʻ i Advanced Visualization Energy Nexus (HAVEN )  
Visualization tools  provide the opportunity to explain the outcomes and tradeoffs 
analyzed in energy system modeling and studies to stakeholders beyond the energy 
sector. With the size of energy investments , in both capital and physical scale, it is 
essential that energy planning discussion s embrace a broader audience including 
communities that energy serves and communities where energy resources are 
sited. T ools such as HAVEN , developed in collaboration with University of Hawai‘i’s 
Laboratory for Advanced Visualization and A pplication (LAVA) through U.S. DOE 
funding , provide  an approachable representation of the tradeoffs of alternative 
energy scenarios  to spur meaningful conversation on significant conversations on 
large capital and physical investments .   
HSEO is working with LAVA  and fellows from the University of Hawai‘i’s  Data 
Science Institute to both conduct energy system analysis and to build on HAVEN 
technolog y to support engagement with decision makers  such as legislators and 
impacted communities through HSEO’s JOBS branch . HSEO collaborated with the 
data science fellows to develop an updated implementation of HAVEN on HSEO’s in -
house AWS Cloud infrastructure, continue to mature existing Tableau data 
visualization capabilities, and strengthen foundational data pipelines.  It is worth 
noting that federal grants prioritize  applications with community engagement plans 
and HSEO has created a branch to engage communities . HAVEN and other 
visualization tools su pport JOBS staff conducting community engagement.

Oʼahu  Energy System Visualization  
In collaboration with LAVA, HSEO has been working on the creation of an 
educational Virtual Reality (VR) platform focusing on O‘ahu's energy infrastructure. 
The project involves the meticulous 3D documentation of existing energy facilities 
49 
 across the island, encompassing refineries, solar and wind farms, energy storage 
installations, waste -to-energy facilities, and a hypothetical offshore wind farm.  
Utilizing state -of-the-art VR technology, the objective is to furnish a comprehensive 
educational resource for both the public and legislative stakeholders. The immersive 
VR experience will enable users to virtually observe these facilities from both fixed 
vantage points  and birds-eye flyover views . The VR platform wil help provide  a 
better understanding of the O’ahu  Energy System  and what proposed energy 
infrastructure looks like within surroundings that residents are familiar with . The 
intent is to foster  a heightened awareness and comprehension of O’ahu's current 
energy landscape.  
The development of this VR platform aligns with the mission of the HSEO to 
enhance public understanding of complex energy systems  and supports outreach 
and engagement activities conducted by the JOBS branch. By delivering a visually 
engaging and informative tool, the initiative seeks to contribute to the collective 
knowledge base, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding 
the sustainable energy future of O’ahu. As we continue to expand the coverage of 
documented facilities, including potential future developments, the VR platform is

Energy Data Portal   
HSEO hosts a single source repository for energy related data to provide a solid 
foundation for a data -informed approach to achieving the State’s energy goals. It 
serves as a one -stop-shop for reliable state energy data, and to ensure energy 
policies and r egulations align with the state’s clean energy goals. HSEO is working 
with fellows from The Data Science Institute at The University of Hawai‘ i to 
maintain and extend data sets from public and private sector sources.  The Data 
Portal includes  both source data and curated data sets which integrate multiple data 
sources.  Curated data sets are valuable in a few ways. Some data sets, “big data” , 
are so large that they can be difficult to process and digest into meaningful 
information from which to conduct analysis. Curated data sets take the “big data” 
and make it actionable for analysts to use. Curated data sets can also provide 
greater access to information that would otherwise be confidential. HSEO has 
experience with, and access to , confidential information. By linking and processing 
the data HSEO can anonymize the data  set provided while protecting underlying 
personal identifiable information (PII) and protected critical infrastructure 
information (PCII).   
50 
 Stakeholders and interested citizens can easily view and interact with data to 
become better educated and informed about Hawai‘ i’s energy landscape and the 
state’s progress towards its clean energy goals.

 Energy Program Administration and Funding  
Introduction 
HSEO operates under a working organizational structure with statutory 
responsibilities assigned to branches given the integrated nature of the statutory objectives and activities. The formal reorganization of HSEO pursuant to Act 122, 
Session Laws of Hawai ‘i 2019, has been initiated.   
 
 Act 122 established the following mission for HSEO: “The purpose of the Hawai ‘i 
state energy office shall be to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy, and 
clean transportation to help achieve a resilient clean energy economy.” Act 122 
created Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) sections 196 -71 and 196 -72, and in so 
doing established the above mission, created the Chief Energy Officer position, 
amended numerous other statutes in addition to HRS Chapter 196, and removed 
the HSEO’ s discretionary use of the E nergy Security Special Fund (ESSF), among 
other changes.     
 The reorganization will incorporate Act 122 and the flexibility of exempt positions 
into five groups:     
 Administration (Admin),    
 Operations (Ops),    
 Jobs and Outreach Branch (JOBS),     
 Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), and     
 Resilience, Clean Transportation, and Analytics (RCA).    
 Each branch is assigned a team of employees with knowledge, skills, and abilities 
relevant to the scope of objectives assigned to the branch. The Chief Energy Officer, 
Deputy Energy Officer, and branch managers regularly assign priorities and staff to 
comp lete work, including when work requires cross -branch synergy and designating 
a lead branch for a particular effort, which is frequent.     
Act 248, Session Laws of Hawai‘ i 2022, appropriated $2,216,673 in FY23 General 
Funds for HSEO’s positions and operating costs. The position ceilings allocated by 
Act 248 included 1.00 permanent position and 27.00 temporary positions. $565,000 
in Special Funds was appropriated from the E SSF to provide funds to leverage 
federal grant fund and to pay special fund assessments.    
Act 238, SLH 2022 appropriated $350,000 in FY23 out of the ESSF for HSEO to 
analyze pathways and develop recommendations for achieving the State’s 
economy -wide decarbonization goals.  HSEO has contracted for the necessary 
analysis and technical support to inform regulatory or other state action to ensure the State’s decarbonization goals are met. The analysis shall inform the determination of    
 52 
 cost-effective pathways and help to rank the recommendations based on levels of 
impact, cost,  and ease of implementation.   
To provide adequate staffing for HSEO activities and programs, three temporary 
100% federal funded positions were established and filled during FY23. Although not sustainable, the positions are essential to fill critical ongoing needs.   
 
 An Energy Training Specialist position was established to focus on 
coordinating activities for the backbone and lead organization in the Clean 
Energy and Skilled Trades sector of the Good Jobs Challenge. Over the 
course of this grant, the Specialist will w ork with the University of Hawai ‘i 
Community Colleges (UHCC), industry associations, employers, service providers, trainees, community -based organizations,  and others to develop 
and implement effective and high -impact career and technical education and 
workforce training that meets the needs of the Clean Energy and Skilled 
Trades sector which includes energy efficiency, conservation, renewable energy, and clean transportation.    
 A Special Projects Manager was hired to direct and coordinate the 
development and submittal of the Hawai ‘i Pacific Hydrogen Hub Full 
application in response to the Letter of Encouragement from the USDOE 
Clean Regional Hydrogen Hubs funding opportunity.    
 A Decarbonization Program Manager was hired to lead the development of 
the state’s first economy -wide decarbonization strategy, which in accordance 
with Act 238, will “analyze pathways and develop recommendations for 
achieving the State’s economy -wide decarbonization goals” and other 
decarbonization plans.      
 
Administration  
HSEO’s administration is supported by the Operations team which provides 
accounting, grants management, budgeting, procurement and contracting services, 
personnel management, and internal tracking of programs and projects with timely 
status updates and met rics. The team is responsible for actively seeking and 
tracking federal funding opportunities for grants that present viable funding and align with HSEO goals and priorities. It ensures HSEO’s compliance with federal 
regulations for its federal grants and agreements, with specialized knowledge of 
U.S. Department of Energy programs; the Hawai‘ i Public Procurement Code, 
chapter 103D, HRS; and the Hawai‘ i Ethics Code, chapter 84, HRS. The team also 
assists the public by processing Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA) requests 
for government records. The administrative team develops and implements 
processes and procedures to facilitate and expedite the work of the entire office.    
 
   
Energy Security Special Fund*  53 
 The Energy Security Special Fund was created in 2008 to support Hawai‘ i’s clean 
energy initiative programs and projects that promote and advance dependable and 
affordable energy, renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy self -sufficiency, and 
greater energy security and resilience for the State and public facilities. In FY 20, 
when General Funds were appropriated for HSEO’s positions and operating expenses, the ESSF expenditure ceiling was eliminated.    
 
In FY23, ESSF revenue from the Environmental Response, Energy, and Food 
Security Tax (“Barrel Tax”) was $1,263,373. The projected annual accrual of this 
fund at 4 cents per barrel is $1,040,000.     
An ESSF expenditure ceiling of $565,000 was approved for FY23 to provide funds to 
leverage federal grant funding and to pay special fund assessments. This enabled 
HSEO, as a grant subrecipient for an award from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, to provide the working capital for eligible project costs. The 
ESSF expenditure ceiling allowed HSEO to contract for the development of 
prioritized energy mitigation strategies for critical O’ahu facilities to help O’ahu 
communities become more energy resilien t to hazards. Expenditures from the ESSF 
will be reimbursed with federal funds from HI -EMA. Without the upfront expenditure 
of ESSF monies, HSEO would not have been able to execute the federal grant and 
would have forfeited $600,000 in federal funds.
