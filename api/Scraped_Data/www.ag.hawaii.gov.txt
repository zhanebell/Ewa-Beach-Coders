THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PARTNERS WITH DEA AND LAW ENFORCEMENT  
AGENCIES  ON NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG TAKE BACK DAY  
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
October 2 3, 2024  
 
HONOLULU – The Hawaiʻ i Department of the Attorney General is partnering with the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); Hawaiʻ i Department of Law Enforcement  
(DLE), Narcotics Enforcement Division ; and local law enforcement agencies to 
participate in the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.  
 
The department encourages everyone to help keep communities safe from the abuse 
and misuse of prescription drugs by participating in the National Prescription Take Back 
Initiative on:   
Saturday, October 26, 2024  
10:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.  
 
Anyone with expired or unused medications is encouraged to bring them to the drive -
thru collection sites located on O ʻahu, Maui, Kauaʻ i, and Hawai ʻi island s. 
 
The Take Back  event s are conducted twice a year and are free and anonymous 
services to the public –  no questions asked. Tablets, capsules , liquids and other forms 
of medi cation will be accepted. Everything can be kept  in its original container. No 
labels need to be removed. Vaping devices will also be accepted, but batteries must be 
removed. New or used syringes will not  be accepted.  
 
“The National Take Back Initiative is part of DEA ’s ongoing commitment to promote the 
health and safety of all Hawai ʻi residents, ” says DEA Honolulu District Assistant Special 
Agent in Charge Victor Vazquez . “The results of these semi -annual take back events 
are substantial with thousands of pounds of unneeded, potentially dangerous 
medications being collected and safely destroyed.”  
 Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 2024 -46 
Page 2 
  
  “The Department of Law Enforcement wants to encourage the public to turn in unused 
or unwanted medications at any of the community take back locations.  By safely 
disposing of unused or unwanted medications, through the National take Back Initiative, 
we nev er have to worry about those medications being misused,”  said DLE Deputy 
Director Jared Redulla.  
 
“This is a great opportunity to rid unused and expired medications  from your home.   
Prescription drugs thrown in the trash can be retrieved by others to abuse. Let’s work 
together to keep Hawai ʻi safe f rom prescription drugs entering our land and ocean,” 
says Valerie Mariano, branch chief, Community and Crime Prevention Branch, 
Department of the Attorney General.  
 
Medicine should not be thrown in the trash or flushed down the toilet . The following are 
reasons why it is important to properly dispose of unwanted and unused medication.  
 
• Proper disposal reduces the risk of prescription drugs entering the water supply 
or potentially harming aquatic life.  
• Having unused or expired medicine in the  home increases the risk of accidental  
 poisoning. Homes where children or the elderly live are especially vulnerable to  
 this danger.  
• Children may mistak e medicine for candy.  
• Medicines may lose their effectiveness after the expiration date.  
Go to http://ag.hawaii.gov  for a list of the October 26 Take Back locations in Hawaiʻi.  
If unable to participate in the Take Back event, t here are also several  year-round 
medication drop- off sites in Hawaiʻ i. To find your nearest location visit

News Release 2024 -45 
ATTORNEY GENERAL LOPEZ URGES FEDERAL JUDGE TO ORDER T HE FDA TO 
REVIEW ITS RESTRICTIO NS ON ABORTION MEDICATION MIFEPRISTONE 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
October 14, 2024 
HONOLULU – Attorney General Anne Lopez is urging a federal judge in Spokane, 
Washington , to rule that the U.S . Food and Drug Administration’s restrictions on the 
abortion medication mifepristone are inconsisten t with the Administrative Procedure Act. 
“Since 2000, more than 5.6 million patients have safely used mifepristone . We should 
not be afra id to increase access to a medication whose safety and efficacy is based in 
science and proven over time . Artificial limitations on safe and effective medication are 
actual limitations on access to healthcare ,” said Hawaiʻi Deputy Attorney Gene ral Erin 
Lau. 
The multistate lawsuit was filed last year in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Washington b y 17 plaintiff states , including Hawaiʻi , and the District of 
Columbia. 
Of the more than 20,000 drugs approved by the FDA, only 73 drug s have extra 
restrictions known as a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) , including 
highly add ictive drug s such as Oxycontin . An even smaller subse t of drugs carries 
additional restrictions kno wn as Elemen ts to Assure Safe Use (ETA SU), including 
certa in risky cancer drugs and high-dose sedative s. Despite its proven safety and 
efficacy, mifepristone has both a REMS and an ETASU restriction. 
Although the REMS and ETASU restrictions have been relaxed over time , certain 
restrictions remain. To prescribe mifepristone, health care provide rs mu st be specially 
certified by the drug distributor and submit their certification form to every pharmacy to 
which they send a mifepristone prescription —an administratively burdensome 
requirement that is unique to mifepristone . The pharmacy must a lso be specially 
certified with the drug distributor before it can dispense a prescription. Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 20 24-45 
Page 2 
In order for a patient t o receive the prescription, the patient and their providers must 
sign an agreement that certifies the patient has decided to take the medication  to end 
the pregnancy —regardless of whether they are seeking an abortion or are being treated 
for a miscarriage, which is a common use for mifepristone.  These remaining 
requirements are excessive when considering mifepristone’s safety profile.  
The multistate lawsuit asserts the restrictions on prescribing and dispensing 
mifepristone are unduly burdensome, harmful and unnecessary, reduce access to a 
critically important drug, and expose providers and patients to unnecessary privacy and 
safety risks . The risks are exacerbated by the growing criminalization and pen alization 
of abortion around the country in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ’s decision in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health  Organization . The Dobbs  case overturned nearly a 
half-century of precedent, stripping away the constitutional right to abortion recognized 
by the Court’s Roe v. Wade  decision.  
The plaintiff states  recently  filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to require the 
FDA to review whether mifepristone still meets the statutory requirements to impose  a 
REMS with ETASU restriction based on its safety profile. The motion argues that  
decades of data conclusively show that mifepristone is safe and effective, and that 
medical experts have long opposed the FDA’s restrictions on the medication . By 
keeping the restrictions on mifepristone, the states argue that the FDA is unnecessarily 
and unlawfully limiting access to a medication  that is safer than Tylenol, Viagra , and 
insulin . 
Along with Attorney General Lopez, a ttorneys general for Arizona, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New 
Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont , Washington  and Washington, 
D.C. joined the case.  
A copy of the motion can be found here.

DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LAUNCHES ONLINE RESOURCE 
FOR PEOPLE SUPPORTING THOSE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL -HEALTH OR 
SUBSTANCE -ABUSE ISSUES  
Webpage  is Designed to Help Practitioners and Loved Ones with Assisted Community 
Treatment Legal Process  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
October 9, 2024  
  
HONOLULU  – The Department of the Attorney General has launched a  webpage  for those 
who seek the department’s help with filing assisted community treatment (ACT) petitions in 
family court , to provide treatment for those with serious mental illnesses or substance abuse 
that can render them dangerous to themselves or others.  
 
“Assisted community treatment is a holistic legal framework intended to support individuals with 
severe mental  health and substance  abuse issues in breaking free from detrimental cyclical 
patter ns in which they episodically become dangerous to themselves or others,” said Special 
Assistant to the Attorney General Dave Day. “The Department of the Attorney General looks 
forward to working with practitioners and the people of Hawaiʻi who seek to help their patients 
and loved ones through ACT.”  
 
In 2013, the Hawaiʻi Legislature established the ACT law with the intent of providing support for 
someone who has a mental illness or drug addiction, who has demonstrated that without such 
support they will likely become unsafe in the community, and who ma y have difficulty 
participating in treatment. ACT is based in the community  and is founded upon  a family court -
ordered treatment plan issued after a petition is filed.  An ACT petition may be sought by a 
concerned parent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, adult  child, reciprocal beneficiary, service 
provider, case manager, outreach worker, or mental  health professional.  
 
In 2024, the Legislature provided that the Department of the Attorney General generally shall 
assist with the preparation and filing of ACT petitions and with the presentation of the case at 
any related court proceeding, although such assistance may be dec lined. The department’s 
ACT web page  includes forms and instructions that will facilitate this process , including legal 
definitions, forms and ways of submitting the necessary information to the department.  Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 2024 -44 
Page 2 
  
   
“Assisted community treatment is a practice of providing community -based services to support 
people who have had difficulty engaging with treatment for their serious mental  health 
conditions. ACT can improve a sense of personal engagement in treatment, support recovery in 
the community, and help people who are caught in a revolving cycle of hospitalization, 
incarceration, and homelessness,” said Michael K. Champion, M.D., Sen ior Advisor for Mental 
Health and the Justice System to Governor Josh Green, M.D. “ The Department of the Attorney 
General’s assistance with the ACT petitioning process and court proceedings is an important 
step in lowering barriers and improving access to needed care.”  
 
“In Hawaiʻi, there have been a number of successful ACT cases with individuals suffering from 
severe mental illness. Having an involved treatment team is critical to the success of each of 
these cases,” said  Deputy Director of Behavioral Health  Marian Tsuji . “The Department of 
Health is working to expand use of the law across the state.”  
 
“Through an ACT order, individuals who do not realize the severity of their own illness, as well 
as the risk that treatment noncompliance may pose to themselves or others, are given the 
opportunity to be treated in the least restrictive setting by providers committed to their care,” 
said Deputy Attorn ey General Ian Tsuda, one of Hawaiʻi’s leading ACT practitioners. “The 
Department of the Attorney General recognizes that many in Hawaiʻi face challenges with such 
illnesses and are committed to supporting those seeking help for individuals who need this l evel 
of care.”  
 
The web page  can be found  on the Department of the Attorney General’s website  at 
https://ag.hawaii.gov/act_petition_info/ . The web page  can also be accessed from the 
Department’s webpage in the “Division Links” column or the “Quick Links” pull -down menu.

MAJOR DRUG TESTING LABORATORY AGREES TO PAY $27  MILLION  TO 
RESOLVE ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY DRUG TESTING AND ILLEGAL 
KICKBACKS  
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
Oct. 3, 2024  
 HONOLULU, HI –  Attorney General Anne Lopez announced today that the state of 
Hawaiʻ i has joined the United States, the District of Columbia, and 43 other states in 
settling allegations against Precision Toxicology, LLC d/b/a Precision Diagnostics, Inc. (“Precision”).  The settlement resolves allegations that Precision knowingly submitte d or 
caused to be submitted false claims to the Medicaid program related to urine drug 
testing (“UDT”) that was either not medically necessary or tainted by kickbacks. As part of the settlement the state of Hawaiʻ i will receive $101,416.16 in restitution. Hawa iʻi’s 
share of the restitution is directly related to identified instances wherein Precision had double billed the Hawai ʻi Medic aid Program . 
 Pursuant to the settlement, Precision will pay $27,000,000.00, plus interest, to the United States, the District of Columbia and 43 states to resolve the allegations set forth in three lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the qui tam  provisions of the federal and 
state False Claims Act s, which allow private parties to bring suit on behalf of the 
government and to share in any recovery.  Two of the cases are captioned United States and Maryland ex rel. Hudak v. Precision Toxicology, LLC , ELH -18-1510 (D. Md.) 
and United States, Illinois and Minnesota ex rel. Buonauro v. Precision Diagnostics, 
LLC et al. , ELH -21-3231 (D. Md).  The third qui tam case against Precision, brought in 
the District of Colorado, remains partially sealed.  
  
Precision is a toxicology laboratory that markets and performs laboratory UDT nationwide, primarily for substance use disorder and pain management providers.  The settlement resolves allegations that from January 1, 2013,  through December 31, 2022, 
Precision submitted or caused false claims to be submitted to Medicaid for UDT that 
were  not medically reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an 
illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. Specifically, it Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 20 24-43 
Page 2 
  
  was alleged that Precision developed and implemented a policy and practice of utilizing 
non-allowable blanket orders for UDT without any physician making an individualized 
determination that the UDT was medically necessary or reasonable for the particular patients for whom the tests were ordered.  The settlement also resolves allegations that Precision, during the period of January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014, provided free point -of-care UDT cups to physicians in exchange for UDT referrals, in violation of the 
Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a- 7b(b).  
 A National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (“NAMFCU”) Team investigated the allegations in conjunction with the Department of Justice and United States Attorney’s  Offices in Colorado, Connecticut, and Maryland. The NAMFCU Team 
included representatives from the Offices of the Attorneys General for the states of Florida, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, and Virginia.   
 Landon M.M. Murata, director  of the  Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, Department of the 
Attorney General  (Hawaiʻi MFCU) , and Judy Mohr Peterson, PhD., Med- QUEST 
division administrator , Department of Human Services, entered into the settlement 
agreement on behalf of the state of Hawaiʻ i. 
 The Hawaiʻ i MFCU is a specialized unit within the Department of the Attorney G eneral 
that is charged with conducting criminal and civil investigations and prosecutions of (1) provider fraud against the Medicaid Program, (2) fraud in the administration of the Medicaid Program, and (3) abuse and neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries and residents of board and care facilities  throughout the state of Hawai ʻi. 
 “We are committed to aggressively pursuing those who ignore medical necessity in favor of increasing profits at the expense of patients, taxpayers, and Hawaiʻ i’s critical 
healthcare programs ,” said Director Murata.  
 The Hawaiʻ i MFCU  is funded through a grant totaling $ 3,670,956.00  for Federal Fiscal 
Year 2025, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  - Office of 
Inspector General. The f ederal share of these funds is 75% totaling $ 2,753,220.00. The 
state matching share of these funds is 25% totaling $917,736.00 and is provided by the 
Medicaid Investigations Recovery F und.

solid materials including unauthorized erosion control devices and debris removed from the state land. It also requests an order from the Court that provides the s tate owns the 
land clear of interest or claim by the defendant and  requests a permanent injunction 
preventing the defendant from allowing any structures, solid materials, or debris of any kind on state property. The complaint  also asks that the Court award damages to the 
state for repairing the natural resources affected by the defendants’ illegal actions.  
 “The state has a duty to protect the environment, prevent further degradation of state 
conservation land, and ensure shoreline and beach preservation for future generations ,”

“Private landowners take a risk when they allow structures to be so close to the 
shoreline, ” said Deputy Attorney General Danica Swenson, who is the lead attorney for 
the state on the case. “ The people of Hawai‘i are now confronted with the 
consequences of property owners’ failure s to take heed of the ocean’s warning signs of 
erosion. ”  
 DLNR’s OCCL Administrator  Michael Cain sa ys, “The Office of Conservation and 
Coastal Lands is coordinating with the City and County Department of Parks and Recreation to remove the debris from the shoreline.”

ATTORNEY GENERAL LOPEZ APPLAUDS HAWAIʻI SUPREME COURT DECISION 
UPHOLDING PROHIBITION OF SHORT -TERM VACATION RENTALS ON 
AGRICULTURAL LANDS  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
September 25, 2024  
  
HONOLULU  – Attorney General  Anne  Lopez  applauds the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court’s 
unanimous decision of Rosehill v. State of Hawaiʻi, Land Use Commission , where the 
court held that farm dwellings in the agricultural district cannot be used as short -term 
vacation rentals under Hawaiʻi law. In making its decision, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court 
further held that courts must generally defer to agencies when interp reting ambiguous 
laws, expressly disagreeing with a controversial 2024 U.S. Supreme Court case  that 
overruled the 40 -year-old case of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, Inc . 
 
The County of Hawaiʻi has an ordinance that generally prohibits short -term vacation 
rentals in the agricultural district. In 2020, both the County of Hawaiʻi and certain owners 
of land in the agricultural district of the County of Hawaiʻi petitioned the state Land Use 
Commission (LUC) for declaratory orders regarding the legality of this prohibition under 
state law. The LUC held that a short -term vacation rental is not a permitted use of a 
farm dwelling in the agricultural district.  
 
On appeal, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court agreed with the LUC, holding that a farm 
dwelling may not be used as short -term vacation rentals because “short -term vacation 
rentals undermine” agricultural purposes.  
 
In making this decision, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court expressly deferred to the LUC’s 
interpretation of ambiguous Hawaiʻi law, stating: “In Hawaiʻi, we defer to those agencies 
with the naʻauao (knowledge/wisdom) on particular subject matters to get complex 
issues right.” In making this decision, the court expressly disagreed with the reasoning 
of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 decision of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 2024 -41 
Page 2 
  
  which overruled  longstanding principles of  federal judicial deference to agency 
interpretation of statutes.  
 
State leaders praised the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court’s decision.  
 
“Using agricultural lands for genuine agricultural purposes and ensuring that housing is 
allocated for our residents are two of the most crucial issues facing our state today,” 
said Governor Josh Green, M.D. “I commend that Hawaiʻi Supreme Court for making  
the right decision for the people of Hawaiʻi.”  
 
“Today’s decision makes clear that deference to administrative agencies is a principle 
with continued vitality in Hawaiʻi,” said Attorney General Lopez. “This decision reaffirms 
the importance of agency expertise under Hawaiʻi law.”  
 
“This was a win for preserving agricultural lands in Hawaiʻi. Short -term vacation rentals 
are transient accommodations effectively for vacation or tourist use and do not belong in 
the agricultural district . That was the LUC’s finding when a dozen Hawaiʻi island 
landowners applied to rent out their farm dwellings as short -term vacation rentals, ” said 
Special Deputy Attorney General Doug Chin, a former Attorney General of Hawaiʻi and 
current partner at Starn O’Toole Marcus & Fisher who argued the case before the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court. “The Hawaiʻi Supreme Court unanimously upheld the LUC’s 
thoughtful and well -reasoned decision.”

HAWAIʻI ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNE LOPEZ ANNOUNCES RESULTS OF 
LAHAINA FIRE INVESTIGATION ANALYSIS: NO SINGLE FACTOR, BUT COMPLEX 
INTERACTION OF FACTORS, LED TO MAUI FIRE DEVASTATION  
Report Acknowledges Actions of First Responders and Calls for Urgent Change by 
State and County Governments to Create a Safer Hawaiʻi  
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
September 13, 2024  
  
HONOLULU  – Hawaiʻi Attorney General Anne Lopez announced today the results of 
the Lahaina Fire Incident Analysis Report , the second report of the three -part evidence -
based investigation into how state and county governments responded during the Maui 
wildfires. The report reveals no single factor led to the devastation. Instead, a complex 
set of factors including weather and its impact s, risk and preparedness, decades -old 
infrastructure, organizational structure and incident management and coordination 
created a historic disaster. The report was prepared by the Fire Safety Research 
Institute (FSRI), a part of UL Research Institutes.  
 
“This investigation serves as a wake -up call for the state and county government s to 
learn from the past and urgently prepare for the future,” says Attorney General Lopez. 
“It is also a testament to the courage of our emergency services personnel and the 
everyday heroes who helped thousands of Lahaina residents and visitors to reach 
safety.” This was the most deadly fire in North America in 100 years.  
 
The Phase Two analysis, informed by the April 17, 2023, Lahaina Fire Comprehensive 
Phase One Report facts and timeline , identifies the complex set of factors that led to the 
devastation and includes recommendations that can be implemented immediately.  
 
“Responsible governance requires us to seek answers and better understand how state 
and county governments responded, and how we can best make efforts to prevent 
disasters of this magnitude from happening again,” says Attorney General Lopez.  Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 2024 -40 
Page 2 
  
   
In August 2023, Attorney General Lopez selected the independent, third -party FSRI to 
assess the performance of state and county agencies in preparing for and responding to 
the Maui wildfires. FSRI has extensive experience researching fire dynamics, structu re-
to-structure fire spread, and near -miss firefighting incidents.    
 
“The wildfire preparedness, prevention and operational measures in place that day 
faced significant —sometimes unprecedented —challenges as the threat escalated. 
Insufficient resources and investment across multiple domains hindered the 
development of a unif ied fire management strategy and impacted prevention, 
preparedness and response,” said Steve Kerber, Ph.D., PE, vice president and 
executive director of FSRI.  
 
“The report concludes the devastation caused by the Lahaina fire cannot be connected 
to one specific organization, individual, action or event,” added Kerber. “The conditions 
that made this tragedy possible were years in the making.”  
 
For this research, FSRI used a systems -analysis methodology to evaluate the complex 
intersections between environmental conditions, human activity, established policies 
and procedures, organizational structures, and accepted norms and perceptions. FSRI 
made 84 findings with 140 recommendations to address these issues now. The report 
emphasizes the crucial role multiple entities such as agencies, state and county 
government should play in directly implementing these recommendations.  
 
The Phase Two report identified three areas that need immediate attention:  
 
1. Perception of Risk and Preparedness  
The low perception of wildfire risk is not aligned with the growing wildfire threat in 
Hawaiʻi, which led to a widespread lack of preparedness among county, state 
and privately owned entities and residents. This also includes systemic issues 
tied to years of decisions that have led to underinvestment in wildfire prevention 
and mitigation policies, public education and organizational structure.  
 
2. Infrastructure Standards   
Decades -old infrastructure standards, including community planning, codes and 
standards, public utilities and vegetation management, were key contributors to 
the widespread fire destruction in Lahaina. Lahaina's dense urban layout turned 
tragic as the fire 's initial impact hit the most populated area, rapidly spreading 
through closely packed structures and creating severe evacuation obstacles.   
  
3. Incident Management and Coordination   
First responders heroically saved many lives, placing themselves in extreme 
danger between the unpredictable fire fronts and vulnerable residents. The Maui 
County incident management operations, however, consisted of a siloed 
command structure that contrib uted to a lack of communication both to the public 
and responding agencies. The lack of pre -event planning, unified incident 
command and operational coordination with assisting and cooperating agencies Department of the Attorney General  
News Release 2024 -40 
Page 3 
  
  resulted in insufficient communications that impacted the ability to provide 
effective evacuation and firefighting operations during the wildfire event.  
 
“Our Phase Two report shows that Lahaina lacked the level of cohesive fire prevention, 
preparedness, management strategy, resources and investment that are necessary to 
protect the population from an extreme wildfire event,” added Kerber.  
 
The focus of the Phase One Lahaina Fire Comprehensive Report and timeline was to 
identify the facts; the Phase Two Lahaina Fire Incident Analysis Report is the scientific 
analysis with recommendations that can be implemented more quickly; and Phase 
Three will focus on broader systemic recommendations for the future.  
 
Attorney General Lopez also announced the comprehensive database  of documents 
and media obtained during the investigation is now publicly available. It contains 
approximately 850 gigabytes of video files, audio files, photographs and documents 
relating to the August 8, 2023 Maui fires obtained by the Department and FSR I in 
connection with this investigation. Among other files, this database contains:  
 
● Maui Police Department (MPD) body camera footage and other videos of the 
fire event;  
● 911 dispatch audio files;  
● Vehicle location data for MPD and Maui Fire Department vehicles during the 
fire event;  
● Notes, sign -in sheets, photographs and other documents created within the 
Maui Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on August 8, 2023, and afterward;  
● FSRI damage assessment videos and images;  
● Audio recordings of interviews conducted by FSRI with dozens of state and 
county officials; and  
● All manner of documents from state, county and federal agencies.  
 
Access to this database is being provided as a public service by the Department of the 
Attorney General at no charge so all of the people of Hawaiʻi may learn directly from the 
source documents regarding this tragedy.  
 
“From the outset, our commitment to transparency in this investigation has been of 
crucial importance, and the release of this database honors our continuing 
commitment,” said Attorney General Lopez.  
 
“We are not here to place blame . It is clear from the Phase Two analysis that we need 
to make significant changes at the county and state level  and involve a broad range of 
individuals and organizations, to ensure we are better prepared for future wildfires that 
are not only possible, but increasingly likely,” added Attorney General Lopez . “Good 
governance requires we take these science -based recommendations seriously and 
work together to implement changes in our processes and protocols to save lives and 
property and ensure Hawaiʻi is safer and has a more sustainable future for residents 
and visitors.”

ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNE LOPEZ JOINS MULTISTATE COALITION URGING 
SURGEON GENERAL WARNING ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS  
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
September 10, 2024  
  
HONOLULU – Attorney General Anne Lopez and 41 other attorneys general today jointly 
called on congressional lawmakers to pass legislation requiring a U.S. S urgeon General 
warning on all algorithm -driven social media platforms. The letter comes amid growing scrutiny 
of social media companies for their role in generational harm to young people’s mental health.  
 
States have already taken historic action to hold platforms accountable for the harm they have 
caused young people. Last year, 45 states and the District of Columbia brought lawsuits against 
Meta, and many states are either investigating or actively suing TikTok in state court.  Despite 
these efforts to address the harms caused b y social media platforms, the attorneys general say 
the need for federal action is clear.   
 “We believe that issuing warning labels pursuant to the U.S. S urgeon General’s 
recommendation is an important step toward protecting our keiki from the risks and harms 
posed by social media platforms.  We are hopeful that Congress recognizes this growing crisis 
and will enact legislation to address this issue soon, ” said Christopher Han, a deputy attorney 
general with the Department of the Attorney General’s Commerce  and Economic Development 
Division.  
 
The attorneys general say more action is necessary because “social media platforms have 
demonstrated an unwillingness to ﬁx the problem on their own.”   
 Attorney General Anne Lopez joins the attorneys general of Alabama, American Samoa, 
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, 
Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Virginia, Was hington, Wisconsin,

NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS UPHOLDS CRUCIAL LAWS REGULATING 
CONCEALED CARRY OF FIREARMS  
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
September 6 , 2024  
  
HONOLULU  – In the case of Jason Wolford v. Anne E. Lopez , the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals issued an opinion upholding crucial Hawaiʻi laws intended to protect the public from 
gun violence.  
 
In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court made a significant change to Second Amendment law in the 
Bruen  case , which affected state laws restricting the public carry of firearms.  
  
Following the decision , Governor Josh Green , M.D.,  signed Act 52 in 2023 , establishing a 
comprehensive framework for firearm regulation, recognized nationwide for its public protection 
measures.  Act 52 ensures that those carrying firearms in public are law -abiding and do so 
safely, to protect Hawaiʻi ’s residents as much as possible in the post -Bruen  era. Among other 
things, Act 52 instituted a default rule that firearms are prohibited on another’s private property 
unless they received express authorization from the private -property owner, and instituted 
specific “sensitive places” where firearms generally  cannot be carried.  
 
In 2023, a U.S. District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of 
the law requiring that firearms are prohibited on private property open to the public without 
express authorization, which essentially allowed firearms to be carried on such property unless 
firearm s are expressly prohibited. The decision further enjoined , or halted,  the enforcement of 
laws that prohibited the carrying of firearms in public beaches, public parks and adjacent 
parking areas; bars and restaurants that serve alcohol and their adjacent pa rking areas; 
financial institutions and their adjacent parking areas , and parking lots shared by government 
and non -governmental buildings.  
 
The Ninth Circuit’s decision  today  almost entirely reversed the district court’s  injunction, 
reinstating crucial laws intended to protect the public from gun violence. In particular, the Ninth 
Circuit upheld Act 52’s default rule prohibiting the carrying of firearms on private property owned 
by another without their consent in full , as well as  the prohibitions on the carrying of firearms on 
beaches and parks , and restaurants and bars that serve alcohol, along with their adjacent 
parking areas.  Department of the Attorney General

“The state of Hawaiʻi takes public safety seriousl y,” says Solicitor General of Hawaiʻi 
Kalikoʻonālani D. Fernandes. “This is a significant decision recogniz ing that the state’s public 
safety measures are consistent with our nation’s historical tradition.”  
 
“We are very gratified that the court of appeals rejected the trial court’s overly broad restriction 
on Hawai ‘i’s ability to keep our people safe,” said Special Deputy Attorney General Neal Katyal 
of the law firm Hogan Lovells, who formerly served as the U.S. Solicitor General. “Hawai ‘i’s gun 
safety laws are grounded in common sense, and we will fight vigorously to protect them.”
